here's the notes for the campaign!

# Reading these notes

Edited with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

You can of course read notes with anything that understands Markdown or just in Github, but you'll loose:
- navigation through links and tags
- any Canvas (maps) (format only readable by Obsidian)

# Perspective

These notes *try* to be relevant to the entire party instead of being centered on my character.

# Links are good

We have links. they should be used as often as possible.
If a page exists about something, any reference to it should be a link, not just the name.

# Checklists

## Starting each session

#### Session log

> **For readers:** `git pull`, to recieve the last session's changes.

1. Create it, duh. See [[Session logs/_README#Sessions]]
2. Add Start checkpoint.

## After each session

#### Session log

1. Add End checkpoint.
2. At the top of the file, a new header is added: `# Recap`.
  This lists important things that happened, with links to where they are detailed in the log.
  The section is closed with a markdown separator line: `---`
3. A descriptive title is added. [[Session logs/_README#^1bb1d4]]
4. `git commit` + `git push`
