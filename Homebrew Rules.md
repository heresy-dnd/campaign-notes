### Exception: "because i said so"

DM can just decide to give a spell its cost back.

Here is a list of spells that have previously been **forced to have a cost**:

# Shared Dream sessions

**If two or more characters sleep in close proximity (long rest), they get created a "slot" which can be filled with a dream session.**
One player gets selecte to "take the lead" with the dream: they are now a DM, their character, and in general can do whatever as long as everyone else is okay with it.

The DM acts as kind of their own character's subconsciousness. While I intended the environment in dreams to be reflective of the character's mental state, that is a guideline, not a rule.

**All characters in the dream experience the dream and have the memory about that dream happening.**

### Mechanics

- If the character rolls for perception and gets a nat20, they become aware that this is a dream.
- There are no death saving throws, unless DM really wants them to exist. If someone dies, they wake up. That's it.

### Allowed things

- If players feel like it, they can take turns DMing inside a single slot, so it can be like multiple dreams that flow into each other.

### Avoid

- It is **highly discouraged** to host dream sessions for long rests that have not happened yet.
- It is generally best to not have the DM include player characters without those players participating in the session.
  *You probably dont want someone to make your character do things, after all, it's your character.*
