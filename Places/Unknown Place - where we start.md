> No map for now, since given the portal and dissolving terrain, its uncertain if this is a conventional, static space.

A tunnel, half collapsed.
A door.
A room with machinery and spare parts.
A chamber with a ritual-like machine.

The floor opens into a void.
We are dropped onto a platform of incomprehensibly mashed together machinery and gears.

The plaform is dissolved.
A portal appears below.

We fall in a lake.
