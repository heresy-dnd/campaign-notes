A village.

> As you reach the first few houses, you realize that this place is much bigger than you thought
> The houses are quite tall. Some lean more into the victorian aesthetic while others are quite weird as they are 3 or 4 floors high. These look kind of square and stony all around.
> (For reference, think of modern housing but made with bricks and wooden pylons)
