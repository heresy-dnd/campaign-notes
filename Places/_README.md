# What this directory contains

- Notes about places
- Places may be at any level of scale

# Structure

If a place contains multiple places, a directory with that place's name is created.
Inside it:
- a note, named `_` and then the same name of the directory, details what is to be said about the place.
- all other notes of places inside this place.
- or directories like this one.

# Maps

A map is a canvas that contains notes and/or other maps.
Blocks are placed roughly where they should be, connected with known connections.

> Avoid writing info in the map directly. It should be in notes, that are referenced by the map.
