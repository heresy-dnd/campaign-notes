Bartender / Inn manager... and a bit more.

#todo this page needs to be updated now that we've seen what his deal is

(Presumably) son of [[Roko]].

Chronically bored.
Deals with some *funny* magic in the inn: a magic door that can be connected to any of the inn's rooms, has wards in place or counterspells just to avoid disturbance to the guests...

# Appearance

> To give you a description, Erik is a man roughly 170cm tall with a roundish face, brown eyes and blondish-brown curly hair that drop right before his shoulders. He wears a crimson red linen shirt with a breastpocket, formal pants and nice shoes. On his right index finger he has a thick silver ring with a purple gemstone.
