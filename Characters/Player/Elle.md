> *In your case Solveig, you've tried to forget. All this impossibly long time you've been trying to forget everything you've heard, and everything you saw.*
> *All your life you've been thinking this power of yours to look into pathways in between the realms was a gift, when it quickly became a curse once you took one step into one wrong pathway you should never have known it even existed.*
> *Being taken over by curiosity, you'd sneak very carefully into this weird plane, despite all the efforts from your retainer to stop you. You should have heard honestly. But you could never imagine you'd be 5 steps in and already walking over a metallic catwalk positioned roughly 5 meters above a boiling cauldron of thousands, if not millions of souls.*
> *Not being able to hold back, you let out a scream in fear as the poor souls of the damned wail under you in pain. This scream of yours though caught the attention of something, no, someone far worse than every war that has happened and will ever happen combined.*
> *Turning to face you at the edge of a catwalk you see the dark, shadowy figure of a man where the only destinguishalbe features are his glowing eyes and the armored gauntlets he is wearing.*
> *As he covers the distance between the two of you in a single step, you have no time to react and look up as he grabs you by the neck of your shirt and throws you in the cauldron to meet your fate with the rest. As for the last thing you remember, it's him slowly pacing towards the open pathway you came from and leaving to the other side.*
