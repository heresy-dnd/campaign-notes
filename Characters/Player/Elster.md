*Played by Arri*

Class: Warlock
Race: #unknown 

> *The last one, and probably most unfortunate one of you all, is you Elster.*
> *You truly have been useless your entire life.*
> *You never managed to accomplish anything outstanding. From your position, even accomplishing the most mundane every day tasks deserved a praise.*
> *If it was not for that damned orb hanging around your neck and your dear friend Ariane from the village, nobody would be surprised, not even bat an eye if you offed yourself.*
> *Every day you'd be bullied by your peers from the other noble families by day and go to sleep with that God awful Regent by night. Was it not for the condescending, yet reassuring at times, you'd have lost your mind. Not like you didn't lose it in the end.*
> *Last things you manage to remember was while being waterboarded by the next in line from some other noble house you'd grab a glimpse of **the orb** violently glowing white off tones as you saw the vision of a man staring down at you from above the fountain every time they dunked your heard in. You faintly managed to hear him say "Th- -m ac-er-es".*
> *At that moment it is as if everything stops, the world drowned in shades of gray.*
> *As he picks you up out of the fountain and drops you a bit off to the side, you see a man looking down on you with bright white eyes and very ornate metallic gauntlets and he tells you in a very familiar condescending tone "Now that he is is out of the way dumbass, you were not that useless after all."*
> *"You have managed to accomplish what I hoped your family should have achieved in the past 4 generations by getting your ribs kicked in time and time again, truly a remarkable feat."*
> *Now I just need to get that orb back and I can finally finish this plan, and it's not like you can put up much of a fight anyways. Well, it does not have to stop here really. How about we work together for a bit. Let me finish the job I am supposed to do and then I will let you be on your way. What do you say?"*
> *As those final words exit this man's mouth he extends his hand towards you with a wide grin as if he is waiting for you to accept his pyramid scheme business proposal.*
> *But having nothing else to lose, you accepted anyways. And oh boy as bad if not worse than a pyramid scheme it quickly became.*
> *Shaking his hand you quickly feel all the life drain out of you as you are forced to look the man in the eyes. And after that it's a haze.*
> *After that it's all a weird mismatch of moments. You looking down examining your hands and new found powers. Pacing through the streets of your neighborhood, closely examining the chaos that ensued from people being shot on the spot to women and children being dragged out of their homes from giant stacks of metal.*
> *You remember the downfall of everything from the school you were to attend, to the village you'd sit in a warm hug under a tree with your dear friend, only now you'd hold their bloodied body in their arms.*
