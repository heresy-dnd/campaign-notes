> *For you [[Horin]], it's like yesterday you were preparing for that assault against the cultists. You still remember the faces of your comrades, all cheerful and ready to retake their homeland. Could not hide the heavy atmosphere however since most, if not all, did come to terms with the fact most of them would not be coming alive a long time ago.*
> *If only you knew what would cause such a great rapture and make everyone fall deep down into that wretched chasm, your plan would have been perfect. And now you're here.*

# Appearance

Horin would seem to be a rather large half orc wearing chain mail, though oddly without a helmet.
He is bald, like any half orc.
