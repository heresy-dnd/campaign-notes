> *Your fate Hornraven is not less tragic than the rest. After doing various odd jobs from killing small fry that owe to loansharks to stealing weapons from officers, you managed to secure enough money for you to find a ship and a small crew.*
> *Having heard time and time again, you managed to track down the location of the legendary sword of ..... not that you ever cared. You just knew deep down it would fetch a very high price.*
> *After setting off, you finally once again felt at home. You have finally answered the call of the oceans you used to travel every day. Turns out this trip would not last very long.*
> *Approaching the presumed location of your prized booty, your ship was demolished with one quick strike of the tentacle from this monster.*
> *You knew, you still know to this day however that this is not some mythological creature of the seas. You were too confident in your abilities to take down anything. But deep down you could not have defeated such a beast even with your old ship and crew. Wouldn't even stand a chance.*
