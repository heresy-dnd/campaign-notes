[[#*Unnamed, unknown characters|Every*]] character should have a note.

> Not every single note needs to fill this template. Not every character has all information.

# NPC

### Importance levels

NPCs are sorted by **importance level.** This can be somewhat arbitrary, and can change as the story progresses.

> Importance level is decided when writing a note.
> Don't predict where they might end up later, throw them where they are IN THE PRESENT.

No character can go down in importance level, except if really needed as a correction. Not even death demotes a character.

> Because nobody can go down in importance level, if in doubt where to place them

##### Threat and importance level

If someone is a threat, it may be natural to give them higher Importance Level.
**As a guideline, avoid that.**
If a threat is relevant - rather use On My Mind to make a note of it.

Think of it more like "how treatening is this to the world" instead of "how threatening is this to our party".

#todo but first of all the rest of importance level judgement isnt relative to world, it is relative to party. and second, being involved in a threatening relationship IS relevant. i might have to rethink this.

##### Level 1 : Major

These are MAJOR characters. 
If you hit your head and forgot everything, and nobody gave you this list, you would certainly struggle to play.

##### Level 2: Relevant

Characters that matter in some way.
If it isnt **major** or **unimportant**, it's relevant.

##### Level 3

All named characters need a note. Not all named characters are relevant. This is where they go.
Generally, these could be:
- characters you pass by and interact only once with
- characters that are neither useful or dangerous
- characters that dont have a major role in something that is relevant

### File structure
Within each importance level folder, there is no particular structure.
Add everyone together or make directories, it doesnt matter.

### \*Unnamed, unknown characters

Almost every character should have a note.
Not every living being in the universe should.
The purpose of noting unknown people is to keep track of them in case they happen to return at some point.

This is especially useful for quickly searching names and seeing if something comes up. 

If a character has no name, but is CERTAINLY relevant: **it is noted**, and the note's name is `Name Unknown: ` and some way of identifying it.

Otherwise: **don't bother noting it.** If needed, mention in Session Log.

If an unmentioned character reoccurs more than once, either: 
- give it a **searchable nickname** in Session Logs
- make a Name Unknown note

# Players

Players have their own dedicated folder.

The Player directory should stay clean and **only with players that are actively playing.**
Therefore, anyone who leaves, is put on standby, or dies, is moved to the **Archive** directory.
**Missing one or a couple sessions doesnt count of course.** By "standby" i mean they have actively decided to take a pause from playing (that character).

Former players that become NPCs still remain in the Player Archive.
