# The shrimple stuff (the place we were in)

![[spooder.png]]
The room's door can be opened, connecting to some building with no apparent exit.
The complex has columns emitting lights around it (described as a "server room"), tubes, cables.

There are metal spiders interacting with them and also acting as some security system by sometimes exploding.
A bunch of them were working on probably repairing one of the columns in a room.
They react when hearing some names: #roko-family . Very similar reaction for anyone in there, also Roko, and the name Elster seems to piss them off.
Refered as "worker bees" by Bob.
There is a very high pitched beeping sound that seems to send them away.

A lot of the complex can only be navigated through vents.

The door from the small room redirects to wherever kind of when it wants to.
The windows show the void regardless of whats behind.
The door can be opened to the void, in which case a wave of extreme cold damages whoever is at the door.
We still individually hear spiders in the small room when we say some specific things.

Uh also pancakes were on the table when we returned????

# Player character lore

## [[Beliminorgath]]
- Forgot the previous day???!?!?!???
	- in his defense, shit sleep and didnt eat. he just a hungry boyo. v tired. bebi go eep. dont blame him

## [[Horin]]
- Confirms what Ariane said about him
- His world had history with shapeshifters: beings that could be anything, be anyone.
	- They were fighting the shapeshifters, that mysteriously vanished once "the new war" began. A lot of the history of this has been lost during the war.
	- Despite this Horin doesnt show hostility to the party
- His world wasnt fighting Roko directly, but his minions.
  They werent physical, disappeared into nothing after they were killed.
  Perfectly visible when alive, never saw flesh or faces.
  Rather easy to kill.
  Dont wear armor, instead robes, drapes, hoodies. ^83fe80
  - and when Elle pointed out, Horin did recognize what [[Swag Messiah]] is.
  - Apparently whatever army Horin was in was killing thousands a day.
- Ended up in the void with an earthquake, ripping the ground apart. Everyone fell.
- Was told the war started after one of their scientists became a megalomaniac.
	- Now thinks that was false.
- "...My people were fighting swag's-" Something in his brain clicks. "He was pulling the strings."
	- "he" Roko? or what?

## [[Swag Messiah]]
- Uncertainly says what Elster said about him could be true
- Thinks the vents are sus
- Funny memory
	- Reaches for a memory he feels he knows, and its absent
	- Has been avoiding trying to test the extent of what's missing
	- So far it has been things from his past that are missing
- Had no idea about [[#^83fe80|what Horin revealed]]. Zero memory. Not even a hint.
	- He remembers fighting - he doesnt remember what he was fighting.
- Vague memory of a... gang? being in the gang?

## [[Elle]]
- Refuses Ariane's talk about being a shapeshifter
	- Doesnt even know what a shapeshifter is, other than children tales. Asks about it.
- Refuses Elster's talk about "her girl"
- Lost some family, isnt really over it
- Has some level of "forgor" and confusion about the past
- Used to travel to "other worlds"
	- Met "others" who also traveled in various ways.
		- Special ships, Magic
	- Made a hobby of exploring, until she crossed Roko's path and he threw her into the void.
		- Accidentally ended up in one of his installations?
		- Roko had both his eyes back then ([[Rick]])
- Her origin world
	- Peaceful, nothing special compared to the others she saw.
		- "didnt have a bad war for more than a century"
			- "some event got me interested in that part of history and when i studied it, it didnt add up. too vague, too clean. i think there was a cover up"
			- "Maps and plans show our city was largely rebuilt after the conflict, but there is no writing about the destruction. This is embarrassing, I know I don't have much..."
			- doesnt know who the fight was against
	- Just humans
	- Magic wasnt even officially a thing

# Weird lore???

> Theres some kind of crossover with Vega's other campaign and its characters?
> Not sure how canon this is, or what the explanation is.
> Regardless, info about that...

Hoto
- Horin walks into one of the rooms and finds this blob 4 meter sphere of liquid metal, speaking in a surprisingly human voice: "Bob I swear to god I am gonna kill you this time, you never let me sleep"
- throws a spear at Horin... Horin still has the spear. The spear has a nametag asking for the spear to be returned
- "well this is embarassing"
  leaves
  refuses to elaborate
- was seen by Horin and Swag

Bob
- a dude in his 20s, "Bob. Bob Murena. Brother of Paulie Murena."
- he works here?
- mad that we blew up 2 spiders, knows Hoto

- ![[Pasted image 20231119112830.png]]
- ?????
- Just randomly opened our shop's door, got in,
  > Confused, they raise a finger and say "Not Arc. Bad."
  > They turn around, go back into the bustling crowd of an unfamiliar (to everyone in the room) marketplace, and close the door after themselves
- then the door lead to void again

# Other lore
