# Recap

We enter in the tavern again.
We order lunch, buy the rooms for the next night.
Cassandra is working there now. She's noticeably slower than Erik.

A set of 3 particularly dressed people enter the tavern. [[#^dbb98b|details here]]
They go up to Cassandra, talking, tense. She looks disappointed, and whatever it is, it's fine and they leave.

We then go back to the guild, this time to sign up and get some money.
The woman there, looking extremely unmotivated, explains us we need to sign the contract with our blood (and also pay money)

We reluctantly do that, she explains us the basics of how stuff works:
- we get rings that denote our rank (we start at the lowest rank possible)
- do NOT give rings to others, they hear voices
- to rank up we need to complete challenges set by adventurers from higher ranks (therefore max rank is basically impossible as the man who has it would probably send you on an impossible mission)
- there is a job board to pick stuff from, the jobs magically show up based on your rank.

We also recieve a map of Aurelia, and a map of Knife's Edge.

We see 3 jobs, and pick the one about a merchant attacked by bandits.

On the way out of the town, we pass in front of a military camp. Quite active, people are moving stuff around. We do hear Erik's voice in there, so we start investigating A BIT MUCH. Nothing notable happens or is found, other than the fact that Erik is present there.

We finish our journey and arrive at the site of the attacked merchant.
There's a broken cart on the road.
Not sure what to start with, we inspect our surroundings: find people, bandits, who when spotted, all get out from hiding.
They talk briefly to eachother, essentially revealing that this is a trap and they produced the work ad.

We successfully kill all 5 bandits, and their wolf escapes.
The session ends, we havent looted or inspected neither the bandits or the cart.

# Start

> So, quick recap of last time.
> After waking up from a proper night's sleep, you decided to start exploring a bit the place you ended up in.
> After you incorporating into the party the cat that Elle brought home, you quickly established through a bit of a scuffed investigation that there is something going wrong, or right, with the inn you are staying at and the tavernkeeper himself.
> After that you decided to go shopping at the guild offices at the edge of town. Having secured some more information about the place you are in and some new fancy trinkets, you've headed back for the inn.
> *For the purposes of this session, Horn has gone of somewhere and Beli is still carrying Cedric's unconsious body around.*
> You are outside the tavern.
> What is your next plan?

We enter the tavern.

> You all enter the tavern. People are just now coming in, potentially it just reopened. Unlike before, it's Cassandra running back and forth this time from the kitchen and to the front of the tavern.

Elle tries to get Cassandra's attention.

> You see her coming out of the kitchen to table for an order then comes back to you "Greetings. How can I help you?"

Elle: "I'd like to take the rooms for one more night. the six on the right side of the corridor"

Cassandra looks a bit confused for a bit before answering "Six... six? Were there not 8?... Or 9? Whatever, in any case 1 copper each please."

She pays for the rooms, and turns to the others "feel free to order lunch, I'm gonna check I still have my bag"

Niko: "Also can I please ask a question miss Cassandra?"

After Cassandra grabs some glasses from a cupboard, she leans over the counter a bit to look at you "Sure thing honey, what is it?"

Niko: "Как называется мой язык в этом мире?"
> 🔮oh Great Orb of Translation, reveal the meaning!
> "In this world, how is my language called?"

Cassandra leans a bit more and whispers slightly "It's gnomish."

Niko: "A bit offensive" 

She slightly recoils from laughter and scoffs it off.

Niko: "Thanks though! Wouldn't expect myself related to gnomes"

Beli: "What could we order for lunch?"

Cassandra: "Mostly everything you can think off, just note it will take a while as I am alone today."

We order stuff to eat...

> Alright, after roughly 30 minutes from ordering Cassandra comes with everything you ordered. *Noticeably slower than Erik*

Niko: "I find it a bit sad we have to use money to get food"

> As you eat, you see a set of particularly dressed people enter the tavern.
> 2 of them are dressed in chainmail armor
> The third one in the middle is wearing a dark blue suit with formal shoes and a silver pauldron on his left shoulder decorated with golden vines.
> They go up to Cassandra and the man in the middle is talking to her a bit, looking very tense. She on the other hand looks quite disappointed and you can guess that whatever it is, it's fine and they reluctantly leave.

^dbb98b

The group is unsure as to who those were...

Eventually we choose to go to the guild to get some money back.

[[Niko]]: "If we're going to need money for everything we should start working"
"In my town everyone works, except children. We usually go to school. But in school there are, uh, posters? that say 'слава труду'. It's something like, i don't know, 'glory to work'"
"so work is good"

Beli: "Do you get money for working?"

Niko: "No, soldiers come on self moving carriages, we call them machines, and take what we make"
"and when we need something it arrives next time they come"

# Signing up at the guild

> You do in fact, walk back to the guild. Everything seems to be more quiet now that time has passed.
> You see a woman there at the booth, half-asleep. Unlike Erik who gave off the unmotivated and bored vibe, this woman looks like she just hates her life.
> She looks up at you a bit, squinting her eyes "Oh, you came back."
> "Are you with your buddies here?"

This is not the same woman from [[Session 4 - Weird inn. Anyways...#The guild shops]].

Beli: "Yes this is our party here, we'd like to register with the guild please"

> She leans over a bit to take a better look at all of you "Ugh, wait a minute."
> She gets up and after a quick stretch, she grabs a few papers from a drawer and hands them to you
> "Alright, sign these with blood please."

Beli, visibly shaken... "With b-blood?"

> "THIS right here is why I hate this job." says as she rolls her eyes "EVERY time."
> "Listen, this is how it works. You sign the contract and then you are tied with the guild magic thing whatever. I don't know I am just doing my job here."
> "You just need a droplet."

Beli: "You can't actually be surprised that 'sign here with blood please' isn't greeted with instant approval"

> She looks at you like she is one more snarky comment before just jumping over the booth "You look like any job you take will have you bleeding far worse than a small prick in the thumb. If you can't sign it I doubt you can complete any adventuring jobs either."

Elle: "You mentioned a contract. What does it entail exactly?"

> "Uhhh something something accepting the guild guidelines blah blah the rankings blah blah blah some things about the guild discounts are not to be shared with memebers outside of the guild and uhhhhhh."
> She looks like she is dazing off a bit there at the last part "Oh right, to do not hand your rings to other people."

"Rings?"

> "The guild rings, denote your rank, the more fancy it is the higher your rank. That's it"

The party resigns and "signs" the contract by getting a few drops of blood out each.

> As the drops of blood drop onto the paper it starts burning up and from the ashes, rings are formed.
> "Alright, now as per official guild rules I am supposed to congratulate you."
> She stands up "ahem Hurrraaaaayyyyyy....."  followed by jazz hands that cause small fireworks to appear

# Explanations for working with the guild

> "Alright, now that the introduction is over, time to go over some things about the guild."
> "First off, as you can see the rings are copper. That is the lowest rank you can get."
> "Each material has 4 rankings. Each rank after the first adds or changes the gem on your ring."
> "Ranks are copper, silver, gold, obsidian and platinum. Each rank has no gem, citrine, garnet, diamond and amethyst."
> She looks like she is dozing off again "uhhhhh oh yeah."
> "Advancing a rank entails completing a challenge set from the higher ups."
> "That being said, do not have any hopes for going up to max rank, one man has that and yeah."
> "Oh yeah, and the maps I am supposed to give you."
> She bends over opening various drawers, making an entire mess of the booth "There we are."

We get [[Aurelia.png]] and the map of Knife's Edge.

Beli: "And about the ring lending thing I asked about?" I turn to the clerc again

> "Oh right, these rings are like, tied to you and stuff. If someone else wears it they start hearing voices."

Beli: "Just voices or does it get worse over time? And does anything happen to me if I lend it away?"

> "Yah it gets worse. The more you wear it the worse it becomes. Just don't. Also no nothing will happen to you, throw it in the ocean for all I care."

> "Oh one last thing."
> "About the jobs you can take."
> "By the road you entered there's a board, jobs appear based on your rank."
> "Yeah that's it." as she says that she instantly collapses as if her battery ran out entirely.

She is snoring. No hecks given.

# The job board

We go to look at whats available to us.
The job board magically shows only what is available to us. *(this was clarified post session)*

1. A giant scribble in all upper case letters "PROFESSOR NEEDS HELP WITH INVENTION!!!!!!!!!"
2. A detailed list of some plants and animal parts for an alchemist to make potions
3. About a merchant who was attacked by bandits.

We discuss a bit, eventually choose the third option.

We need to go to the forest on the road towards Sword's Hilt. [[Aurelia.canvas|Map marker available]]

# We start leaving the town, most reasonable investigation ever

Alright, you start walking towards the edge of the town.
Nearing the edge, you see a fenced off area with a gate on the side of the road. There are many guards running around filling 2 carriages with various stuff and.... cannonballs? Looking into the camp itself you can see a large building in the middle. Behind the building on the back side of the compound, you hear shouting from a familiar voice.

Swag recognizes it as [[Erik]]: "i hear... that's... the barman? from the inn? i think? what is he doing HERE?"

Beli, going towards the guards "Hello there, what's going on over here?"

Niko wanders from the group and approaches one of the men carrying a cannonball
"Hello sir, are you here because of a bandit attack?"

> As he walks with the cannonball in hand he looks tired as hell, after placing it down and taking a few breaths he looks at you "No, the 2nd General asked us to load the carriages. Said he is going somewhere for personal training."
> And immediately goes back to work

Beli walks over to the back, where the familiar voice came from, searching Erik.
Horin follows.
Niko follows.

> As you 3 walk over to the back, 3 guards stop you
> "HALT! What business do you have here?"

Horin: "Adenturing bounty. May we ask why this area is crawling with soliders?" Horin quickly responds.
> Note taker's note:
> IT'S A FUCKING CASTLE. HOLY SHIT. YOU ARE TRESPASSING ON MILITARY PROPERTY. THIS IS THEIR PLACE.
> ahem

Beli: "Adventuring guild quest, here about a merchant getting attacked by bandits"

> As you stand there, the man in the middle looks like [[#^dbb98b|the formal one who entered the tavern]] "This a military camp under the command of 2nd General Von Sorensen. If you do not have any official business, please evacuate the premises immediately. On that note, while the military does not consider adventurers official business, we have not heard nor are preparing for any merhcant."

Horin: After clearing his throat, he looks at the soldier. "Even without us having official business based off your... standards. Please let us through so we may be on our merry way, as per the trade act of your very own general."
> Note taker's note:
> WE DONT HAVE TO PASS THROUGH THE CAMP
> WHY ARE YOU ASKING THIS
> I'M GOING TO START BEING RACIST AGAINST HALF ORCS

> As he understands you are from a military background, his tone kind of changes "At ease pal, you are not in trouble. But I'd expect you to respect military grounds. On that note, we have matters to attend to."
> And they lead you out of the camp back to where you entered from before leaving themselves

[[Niko]]: "Well these soldiers don't seem to be the smiling kind from home" says Niko while the 3 of them are walking back to the road

# We arrive at the broken cart

Beli: "Can we see the merchant first?"
"What does the paper say exactly?"

Niko: "Nothing I haven't said, just that they got attacked and the place"

Elle: "That's... not a job. that's just a report"

Beli: "Wonder why we didn't think to think about this closer beforehand"

Niko: "because we need MONEY, to EAT?"

We all try to inspect our surroundings.

> As you walk towards the cart with caution, Swag and Niko spot movement within the trees and does not take them long to see people hiding there.
> As you go to ask that, one of them drops down
> "Oh man! I told you this was not going to work. Nobody would fall for this stupid trap!"
> To which one comes up from under the cart "I told you that work ad was not convincing enough!"
> "Whatever, stick em lads!"
> And they all come out of hiding

# It's a trap! (Initiative)

23: Niko
19: Swag
18: Elle
9: Beli
1: Horin

![[battlemap for session 5.png]]

We successfully fight off the attack.
All the bandits are killed. The wolf escaped.
Swag was briefly knocked out.
Elle almost got knocked out.

The bandits havent been looted yet.
The caravan hasnt been inspected yet.

The job on the board was fake, posted by the bandits as a trap.
We wont be able to claim rewards from it from the guild - unless they recognize the worth of getting rid of some criminals.
