All **sessions**, the flow of **actions**, and important **things that have been said** are logged here.

# Sessions
Each session is a note.
The note is named:
`Session {number} - {title, decided afterwards}`. ^1bb1d4

# Date

The first line in the note is the date of when the session was played. `dd/mm/yyyy`

# Checkpoints

Discord message links are included periodically, with a small note on what they refer to.
Intended to allow efficiently looking back at details in the original chat.

Every session always has a **start** and **end** checkpoint.
Inbetween checkpoints are choosen "arbitrarily" but shouldnt be too infrequent.

Example:

```md
# Checkpoint name

HH/MM (Username) "linked message is copied here" (discord message link goes here)

(... rest of notes that happen after this checkpoint)
```

# Character dialogue

Links are good, like anywhere else here.
For recorded lines of dialogue, a link to their character page precedes their line:
`[[Characters/Joe Biden]] It gaming time. I gamer.`
