# Recap

After surviving the night attack of horrendous creatures, most of the group goes back to sleep.
The night goes without issue.

Before leaving, we check out the lake, both to better inspect the skeleton that some had a suspicion may be Elster, and because one of the attacking creatures was never seen to retreat.
The first dive fails because of a harmless incident.
The second dive, confidently shows that the creature is not here.
But the skeleton is also... just missing.
*Cedric cooks remarkably good fish? Cool i guess*

The group leaves, walking along the river, through the forest.
There is a cave, that we ignore but try to remember.
We stumble on a small dirt road.
We arrive at the top of a tall hill, where we have a good view of the landscape.
We continue on paths, and find a lighthouse: there is a port.
Walking towards it, as it is the biggest trace of civilization so far, we find 3 fishermen, to whom we talk and get some basic information from.
They indicate the presence of a village, Knife's Edge.

We turn back to go there.
We find a square, with a market.
A brief conversation with a jeweller reveals:
- where an inn can be found
- he recommends not staying outside too much at night
- for some reason, when asked for magic rings, just asking about that is taboo in these parts. but having them is apparently fine?

We go to the inn.
On the way there, through a park next to the inn, we see a glimpse of a girl with white hair and armor. (Potentially elster?)
She instantly runs into the inn.
Following where she went, the man at the counter did not see her.
We buy 6 rooms for today, and go there.
Those who didnt sleep this night probably go to sleep now. (Bran, Beli, Elle)

# Start

> Last time on this fantastic adventure you made it your goal to survive being dropped at a lake in the middle of nowhere. Doing all the things you'd expect from a group of friends to do at a camping trip, you fished, started a fire and set up quite the decent camp.
> Would not be a proper trip however without the lovecraftian horror awaiting in the woods for the right time, which you did manage to survive with no casualties, surprisingly.
> Fending off the forest natives, it is now roughly 2 in the morning as you are contemplating your next move.

The group is now discussing what to do: we are considering to inspect the drowned skeleton.
Also, it is still unclear if the creature that attacked [[Swag Messiah]] is still lurking in the lake.

The group rests, with 3 taking watch: [[Bran]], [[Beliminorgath]], [[Elle]].
The rest is uneventful.
The group wakes up at 6am. ^0b2d91

**ASTOUNDING FIMSH** is made by [[Cedric]]: "My days, this fish is sublime. Praise [[Solara]] for this delightful meal we shall indulge in!"
Also, skooma is canon at least in Cedric's world

# Lake dive 1

The lake water is quite murky, so the skeleton can't be seen.
[[Bran]] ties a rope to a tree trunk.
Inspecting the tree, there are no more [[SCP looking mf]], but unusually large claw marks are seen on the bark, that seem to move from tree to tree.

[[Beliminorgath]] is going to descend down the lake, attached to a rope, with a torch in hand for light.
The rest of the group holds on to the rope, to bring it back up, or takes a watch.

After a few seconds, he reaches the bottom.
He **rolls a nat 1** for 0 total.
He feels his leg held down. Gets the fuck out of the lake in terror.

he was just tangled in seaweed lmao

# Lake dive 2

[[Bran]] tries again.
He gets to the bottom just fine.

Looking through the cloudy water, he does not see anything.
Not because he doesnt manage to find anything, but because there is nothing to be found.
As a man of the sea, his sense of surroundings is quite good, so while the creature is not here, so is the skeleton and all of its belongings.

# Departure

Now that the lake has been inspected, the group gets ready to go.
It's around 8 o'clock.

> Walking through the forest, it's quite serene. Honestly, it even makes you kind of forget the horrors you had to go through last night.
> You can see various colorful berries. flowers and mushrooms. Birds and squirrels inhabbiting the trees and the occasional fish that jumps while following the stream.
> The forest is, indeed, quite bonny
> Rays do not cascade down as the forest roof is too thick and do not allow much light to pass through
> You have been walking for around 30 minutes now. You reach a point where the river splits into a very small creek that flows down into a small cave.

The group considers the cave, but chooses to play it safe, ignore it, and continue.
The location of the cave is noted though.

> Walking for a few more minutes, you manage to find a path. Following this small dirt road, it's not long before the forest starts clearing up.

The road looks recently-ish trampled, so it is in use.

> As the forest gets clearer and clearer, the rocky and mossy fauna is quickly replaced by grass and various types of flowers, both of familiar and uknown nature.
> It has been a long way since you started from the lake, you manage to finally make it out
> Right now you are standing on a tall hill.

# The view from a tall hill

> The river you were following now leads to a larger river that overpowers all the sounds from the forest.
> The what is considered now main river is flowing to your right past the hill to what it looks like the delta of the river. It should be a 40 minute walk to reach it.
> Past the hill, the way you came out of the forest, you see a plateau extend for kilometers, grass forming waves as the winds caress it.
> The road you are on gets larger the further it gets from the forest, and splits into to ways going left and right, parallel to the large river.

*There are flowers, but some dont usually grow in this kind of climate.*

> You decide to take the right path, following the river downstream as it connects with the sea. Right is always right, right? Walking through the cool breeze, taking in the calm scenery, you manage to reach a bridge some minutes before you reach the point where the delta of the river starts.
> Crossing the bridge, the road continues along the face of a cliff. Peeking over you see various sizes of rocks and the beach they have formed as the sea and time have taken their toll on them.
> It's now noon
> As you continue, you start going downhill.
> In the distance, you see something but not quite sure what it is. It does seem like a tower of sorts.

# A port!

The "tower" is a lighthouse.
Next to it, is a medium sized port.
A couple of fishing boats are parked there and one seems like it just arrived and is unloading.

The group starts going towards it.

> Pacing quickly towards the first sign of proper civilization, the road you follow ends on another t junction. Going right is 5 minutes to the lighthouse and to the left you can see 2 or 3 houses by the road.  On the juction you happen to stumble upon 3 fishermen.

# People!

> You wave to the fishermen. The one in the middle greets you back.
> "Good morning travelers. What bring ye here to these parts of [[Aurelia]]? Could you perhaps be from [[Agatha]]?"

[[Bran]] and [[Elle]] try to remember this place, but (roll bad) no memory.

[[Beliminorgath]]: "Shelter and food mostly, and maybe some information"

> The fishermen look at each other a bit, slightly concerned. The one on the right says "You won't find much here" he has a quick pause, "After all this is only the lighthouse and the old port used by us fishermen, you will want to follow the road back and to [[Knife's Edge]]."

[[Beliminorgath]]: "What's got you two so concerned?"

> The middle one looks at you Beli and says "Ah fear naught lad, it's just lately many weird travelers such as ye have passed from here looking for food and shelter."
> He adds "By [[Mathlan]], not sure if you or the lady knight from yesterday is weirder."

[[Bran]]: "You wouldn't know of a small girl among any of these parties perchance? A very...odd girl"

> He scratches his white and salty beard as he tries to recall "Won't kid you lad, I don't recall stumblin over any kid like that."

[[Cedric]]: "Forgive myself for asking so, but whomst is Mathlan perchance? I'm afraid I hail from a foreign kingdom and do not know this term."

> The one on the right turns to you and says "Ah of course, [[Mathlan]] is the goddess of the sea. We fishermen take kindly in her blessings always for a good catch."

[[Bran]]: "Pray, what's the name of this port?"

[[Swag Messiah]]: "...does she also help in lakes?"

> Answering to Swag Messiah,
> "Lakes. Where ye find a lake?" as he ponders over your appearance.

[[Swag Messiah]] answers vaguely.

> Answering to Bran,
> "Ah this port belongs to the village up ahead. The entire region is dubbed knife's edge by the ruling family."
> ℹ️ NOTE this sentence may be confusing. The village alone is later clarified to be knife's edge. Not some region surrounding it.

[[Bran]]: "And what family might that be? Who's the king of these lands?"

[[Horin]] answers more specifically about the lake.
[[Swag Messiah]] and [[Bran]] recommend to avoid it.

> As the one on the right is about to answer, the one in the middle nudges him a bit as if he is signalling something, then says to you "We'd love to chat lads but we best hurry, these fish will start smelling and not be fit for the market." he says, as they all start quickly pacing towards the village.

Insight check on the fishermen's true intentions by [[Bran]] and [[Elle]].
> You do not understand what they truly were thinking, though they seemed quite cautious when you asked about the lord of the lands

The group chooses to continue for the village.

# Shopping?

> You walk backwards along the road, leaving the lighthouse behind you. Not long the dirt path fades into a paved gravel road.
> As you reach the first few houses, you realize that this place is much bigger than you thought
> The houses are quite tall. Some lean more into the victorian aesthetic while others are quite weird as they are 3 or 4 floors high. These look kind of square and stony all around.
> (For reference, think of modern housing but made with bricks and wooden pylons)

[[Bran]] looks for any clues about the town, its inhabitants, and its ruler. He does not see anything of note.

> Walking down the main road, you quickly come to a large open area. It looks like a square, tiled with brick.
> Various market stalls are situated around the square and just as many guards overlooking the area.
> From where you are, you can see immediately see two roads. One continues straight after the square and one to the right that leads to a very nice park with a gazebo in the middle.

It is now roughly 11 AM.
The group decides to talk to a merchant to start getting the lay of the land.

> You approach the first stall your eyes lay upon. It seems to be a jeweler from his wares.

The rest of the market's stalls range from food vendors to blacksmiths

[[Bran]]: "Hail, friend. What have you for sale?"

> He looks at you and says "AH! But a man of the sea. Tell me friend are you interested perhaps for a necklace for ye lass across the waters?"
> "I deal in all sorts of jewelry from rings to crowns and even trade for the materials used in their craft."

[[Bran]]: "Is there much of a trade in crowns in these parts?"

> "For the common people no, these are a bit more delicate items sought either by royalty or wandering merchants. Would not mind taking an order friend if you have the coin however."

[[Bran]]: "Alas I've no need for a crown. I'm in need of some lodgings though, if you know of any. My party arrived here recently"

> "Ah, you need an inn then friend. You should go down the road towards the park and head right. That is where most inns and nightlife generally happen around here. Don't wander at night for too long though traveler." he scoffs as he finishes his sentence.

[[Elle]]: "oh, you mentioned rings, sir. do you happen to have special ones that have functions besides looks?" 

> The jeweler leans over the stall and whispers to you "Look lady, you look like a nice person to me but be careful what you speak of out loud. These parts do not take kindly to these kind of items for reasons and I advice you do not prod so much into it." he adds
> "If you have any that is fine, just do not go selling them left and right."

[[Bran]], going to a fisherman's stall, finds the 3 we met before again.

> The fisherman looks over to you "Ah if it is not one of the travelers. Well met friend what might you need?"

[[Bran]] buys stuff.

Nobody at the market is reacting strangely to the presence or look of the group.

# Hotel!

The group goes to the inn - partly so that [[#^0b2d91|those that did not rest the night before]] can finally sleep.

> You walk through the village the way the merchant told you to follow.
> You reach the park with gazebo in the middle of it. It is quite nice with a nice pond around it and various flowers.

[[Beliminorgath]], looking around in the park, sees something:

> As you relax observing the flowers and the pond, you suddenly spot a young girl with weird armor and white hair run away from the park and into a building

He starts running towards the building, thinking he saw [[Elster]].
This leads into what seems to be a tavern.

> The interior is quite nice. There are several large round tables. On the far wall you see a staircase to the left corner of the wall and the rest of it is blocked off by a bar.
> A man is sitting slouched over the bar counter, pondering the wine bottles.
> The small child is nowhere in the tavern.
> The man behind the counter looks over at you "Are you looking for anyone?"

[[Elle]]: "we were looking for a tavern to eat something anyway, might as well. that too yes"

[[Beliminorgath]]: "a small person, wearing armour and with white hair, happen to see her?"

> He looks back to the wine bottles, then back to you "Can't recall anyone like that entering the tankard friend."

Group insight check on the man behind the counter:

> He seems to be telling the truth

The group rents rooms to sleep for the following night (but its still around midday)

> He guides you to the next floor "The 6 rooms to the right are all yours." he says as he points to the doors in the hallway 
> "The last door to the left is a toilet you can use. For a bath you will have to use a communal one at the hotspring. If you need anything my name is Erikson, I wll be downstairs."
> He goes back down to the bar you assume. One thing of worth is that your room [[Beliminorgath]] happens to have a small crack on the wall, as if someone punched it.

Beli does not pay too much attention to it and goes to sbleeb. he eepy. bebi go to beb.

# Session end.
