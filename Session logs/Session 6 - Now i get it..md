# Recap

PIZZA IS CANON.

\- *seriously now* -
I cant be bothered to make a complete summary, this took so long already.

[[#Start (Fight aftermath)]]
First we handle the aftermath of last session's fight, looting and inspecting.
The merchant, Lau Gan-Lan, is *supposedly* fine and posted the job at the guild.

[[#Bran's intel recap]]
We meet Bran again at the inn, and he gives us the information he gathered while we were split.
Cedric wasnt here and he didnt know where he was.

[[#WARNING SCP HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT]]
Elster... arrives. The reunion is really chaotic, and some of what happened with her in this time is explained.

[[#OHHHHHH NOW I GET IT.]]
Erik realizes our connection to things he is doing, empties the inn and gathers all of us for a talk:

[[#BEGIN LORE DUMP]]
Yeah good luck, start reading lmao

We are forced / whatever to eventually go on a mission to the Shadowfell, to help figure out things that can help fight Roko, who is confirmed to be evil and cringe.

Cedric is also confirmed to be with the professor that was looking for a lizard.
Elster is supposed to go get that by herself.

Elle is shaken at the end and leaves for a walk - [[Session 6b PLACEHOLDER Elle splits off]].

# Start (Fight aftermath)

> Last time we left off at [[Swag Messiah|Messiah]], [[Niko|Messiah #2]], Elle, Beli and Horin having traveled out of town to investigate a crashed merchant's carriage. Turns out, it was a fake job advertisement and they were ambushed by a bunch of bandits (not like you have much they could steal).

Time: Evening, before night

*Niko, hurt from the fight, collapses on the lightbulb, and Horin (appropriately) decides to heal him with lay on hands, but (inappropriately) decides to do so by SMACKING HIM AGAINST THE LIGHTBULB WITH DUBIOUS FRAGILITY.*
> Notetaker's Note:
> Overall, i'd say 6/10 on the Horin's Missing Braincells Moments meter. Come back next episode for more epic brainless moments.

*so anyway niko gets mad and force pushes horin away yada yada ok* and lore wise, it was the lightbulb protecting itself and Niko.

We loot the bandits, and there were ( \* Note 1 ):
- 5 light crossbows
- 5 scimitars
- 26 gold 7 silver
- 2 lockpicking sets
- 1 dagger
- 1 whip
- 3 YEARS SUPPLY OF ALREADY SLIGHTLY STALE APPLES

#todo did i note down the items i took?

Looking closer, the cart did in fact appear to have been stolen in some way... We didnt find a body.

Niko insists we burn the bodies of the dead bandits: "I insist we burn them. Mom did tell me dead people poison the soil"
So we do that.
 > ( Note 1 ) : yeah uh some stuff was still on them so it burned :) 
 > - 1 armor set on the first dude that caught fire

so we get the armor from the others before throwing them to the pile.

*Niko is visibly disgusted with doing this, but considers it utmost neccecary.*

We're done, we return to the village.

# Back to the village

==**TLDR**==
==The return is uneventful. We stop by the guild, where we get to talk to the (previously sleeping) woman at the booth.==
==We get payment for the finished job. Kind of pissed at the unforseen danger we were in, we ask what the fuck is up with that job post.==
==She seems to say that its normal, the merchant is alive and sold her apples this morning, unphased by our concerns.==

> You make your trip towards the town, it's pretty uneventful. If anything you're tired from all the fighting and walking.
> Around midnight, as you expected, you reach the edge of the town, passing by the military camp.
> The guild is right around the corner.

We decide to stop by just to check with them about what the hell that was.

> The booth is... open?
> For sure the light is on and peeking over the counter you see the booth lady curled on the floor with a pillow and blanket sleeping.

The others think if its best to come back the next day, but Swag engages goblin hyperdrive and slams the table to wake the lady up.

> You see her jolt up "Oh- Wha- Eh????"
> She takes a good look at you and the surprise is wiped off clean from her face "Oh, it's you."
> She fixes her skirt and clothing and sits at the chair "yawn Did you deal with the bandits?"

Everyone is kind of being pissed at her because of the unforseen level of danger this mission posed...
Beli: "We got ambushed the moment we got there, and found no sign of any merchant!"

> She stands up, looking zoned out and on autopilot as ever "Hold on."
> She stumbles around the booth and after very clumsily opening every drawer, she finds a pouch, which she places on the counter "Here, payment."

That's 100 gold pieces. #todo Did we take them?

> She then looks at you Beli "Also no it wasn't, it was stated in the job description there were bandits."
> "Like, the merchant himself put up the job."

Next is an awkward back and forth where we're like *NOO THE MERCHANT DIDNT DO THIS IT WAS A TRAP THEY ARE SUSSY BAKAS* and she is like *NO THE MERCHANT IS FINE HES ALIVE IVE BOUGHT APPLE FROM HIM THIS MORNING*

Beli: "Who was (the merchant)? The offer barely had any information"

> She, again, looks over into the various drawers and finds a paper "Here you go, apparently some guy named Lau Ga- she squints trying to read the name Lau Gan-Lan."

*Done with the guild, we decide to go sleep.*

# can we just sleep now

> You make your way to the inn tired, not paying attention to the people.
> As you enter the crowded tavern, you see two things right off the bat.
> a) Erik going behind the counter roughly the same time you entereed and taking of a navy blue shirt (why is wearing his normal clothes under as well)
> b) You spot [[Bran]] sitting at a round table near the bar

Beli: "Oh there's the ranger"

Niko: *"oh no..."*

Bran: "Good evening. Where have you lot been?"

Elle: "Hello again sir Bran, we have been doing adventuring work"

Bran: "Anything interesting come up?"

Elle: "A half dozen bandits."
Beli: "Near death for some of us."
Horin: "we managed to obtain our reward for killing some bandits."
Swag: "It worked out..."

Elle: "Anyone one else hungry? I'll order"
*We eat during this conversation*

Bran: "Ahhhh bandits...
While you lot have been off doing odd jobs, I've done a bit of digging.
Found some...interesting information which may be of use"

Elle: "You have me intrigued"

*on the word 'hungry' niko took their eyes off the bulb and looked at Elle:* "Can I get... uh... ga-teau??"

Elle: "I, huh... will see what they have" She goes to Erik see if they have any cake, sweet or something...

Bran: "I'd rather explain in private.
This is information I only extracted via the influence of alcohol.
Hello niko, how're you getting on with the group?"
He pats niko gently and lightly...

*Niko's not getting patted.* Niko actually strikes Bran with unarmed damage. *And misses.*
"Do not touch me!"

Erik: "Sorry, only one person can make confectionery here and that is Cass. Can't help you sadly."
"Usually, when she has time from her other job...."
"ALSO YOU THERE" he shouts at you Niko
"At least get drunk first before starting a fight so I have an excuse to be lenient."

Niko: "I-I didn't start it!"

*The group still has rooms reserved, and decides to go there to hear what Bran has to say with more privacy.*
Spoiler alert, yeah no that doesnt help but whatever

Beli also passes to check out [[Cedric]], who was left here passed out.
He's nowhere to be found, not even in the room filled with empty liquor bottles.

Swag: "Bran, you've seen him?"
Bran: "Nope. Thought he was with you."
Beli: "So cedric is gone from the premises, and no one has any clue of where he is.
Wait maybe Erik or Cassandra knows..."
Elle: "We can ask them tomorrow. We aren't gonna do a thing about it now anyway"

Beli: "Right. So Bran, what did you find out?"

# Bran's intel recap

Bran:
"It's believed that a few months ago, the old king Randal Anfroi was poisoned and left barely alive. His idiot edgelord teenage son Arnaldus has taken over as regent and everything's got very, very odd. From what I can tell the son doesn't have the capability to try and kill his father which makes me think that there's something more going on. It could also explain why people have been so cagey round here - I think there's something else at work here, possibly related to the shit we found when we arrived by the lake. The castle is at Sword's Hilt and heavily guarded, certainly more than I'd expect for a place like this."
"I suspect whoever poisoned the king has agents all over the place"
"But I don't know whether it's the precursor to a coup or an invasion"

> As you say that, you hear a buzzing from Niko's pocket.
> As you ponder it, it starts glowing and you hear "You have detected one thot"

Bran: "What"
Niko: "it detected a... thought?" 

# WARNING: SCP HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT

==**TLDR:** VERY LONG PARAGRAPH. SKIPPABLE. This is *almost* the entire conversation with few lines omitted.==
==Elster's here.==
==Really fucking chaotic scene.==
==Some of what happened to her in the meanwhile got explained.==
==Elster is still baffled by magic.==
==Erik has been *trying* to teach her. He wants her to do jobs for him.==

> For timing reasons, you (Horin) do not what happened upstairs to Niko but at the same time you see [[Erik]] break his stare.
> You hear him say "Oh fucking hell, do you not have a job to do?" looking towards the door.
> You look to the door yourself and see a familiar child...

[[Elster]] storms into the tavern and rushes towards Erik, paying attention only to him: "WHAT KIND OF A JOB DID YOU PULL ME INTO AGAIN?!"

Niko now hears the commotion. "I.. think I know what exactly it detected. We need to go downstairs. Now."

Horin looks over at Elster, staying silent and thinking how long it would take for them to notice them.

Beli: "Oh that one is back"

Elster: "YOU-" she looks at Horin next to her "AHHH IT'S A PIG!!" she jumps back away from him nearly tripping over herself

Niko: "That's who that thing warned me around!"

Horin: "Well, that is a rude welcome."

Elster takes a few steps back away from the party as she realizes they're all here in shock.

Niko: "thot... haha"

Bran: "Where the hell have you been!"

Swag went full schizofrenia mode and hides, remembering how he treated her in Session 1, fearing that she might react violently.

Elle goes closer to Elster:
"Let's start again, shall we? Hello, good to see you well"

> You hear Erik from the counter say "OH! You are the guys who terrorized her."
> "Good to know. Now if anything, solve this family quarrel at room upstairs."

Elster: "S-so uh... I guess you guys are r-real..."

Bran: "Terrorized? We saved her!?"

> "Wait, hold on. Let me explain."
> "If anything, she deserved it not going to lie."
> "She's a pain to work with I swear."
> He comes around front and sits on the side of the table
> "Quick rundown; few days ago he came rushing in here like a scared cat where she luckily met Cassandra who has a soft spot for children. Since then she has been my problem. So yes, if she is not to pay as per Cassandra's request, might as well put her to work."
> "Not like she has done anything yet, only a delivery."
> "BUT RIGHT NOW SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SLAYING A LIZARD HMMMMM." he says as he leans over your head and shouts at you Elster

Reactions are varied.

"ONLY A DELIVERY?!" she screams at Erik again glaring angrily "I WAS STINKING FOR HOURS"

> "Oh cry about it, you only went down to the sewers relax."

"YOU DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME ANY DIRECTIONS I ALMOST GOT LOST"

> "Whatever, door is that way. Go find that lizard for the professor."
> "I even had to train this useless lard to use magic, which even that can't do properly yet."

"HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KILL A LIZARD?!"

> "Well, I did almost shave her head off with a cannonball but that is a different story."

🤓 "I would appreciate it, if you would stop insulting the poor child, bartender." Horin grunts at Erik.

> "Well, I did almost shave her head off with a cannonball but that is a different story."
> "She is more than capable for a child trust me. Also do not go into military camps uninvited, my men told me about it."

yeah people are unhappy about that one

Beli: "How urgent is the lizard thing?"

> "Frankly.... not at all. The professor just gets angry if he gets to wait cause it "impedes his progress.""

Elster: "Y-you guys know how to use magic...?"
Beli casts mage hand, grabs a mug and waves it in front of her.

> Erik smacks the top of Elster's head "YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT AS WELL."
> "MAGE HAND MOST COMMON SPELL."

"OWIE-" Elster slightly crouches down and rubs her head

Bran: "OI"
> HE LEARNED

> "Listen, she survived being drowned. She will be fine."

She suddenly looks up at Erik glaring with no expression "You tried to kill me."

> "You are supposed to be dead."
> "Next time do not ressurect yourself I don't care."

Elster kicks Erik in the shin. It hurts her more than him.

Bran: "I want to hear the full story. Now."

> "Remind me tomorrow."

> *Yes, it was her when we first arrived at the inn. [[Session 3 - Civilization!#Hotel!]] Yes, Erik let her hide.*

"I've never seen magic in my life before appearing here..." she looks down confused

> "Do the iron fist thing again."

"Eh-?!" she looks up at erik in surprise

> "Do it I said, or else I am dragging you back to the beach."

"I can't just do it-!" she pouts at erik again

> ".... useless."

After hearing what Erik just mentioned, Horin's eyes widen as something snaps inside of his brain. He quickly stands up and stares at Erik. "Wait a second..."
"You." He quickly aims his battleaxe at Erik. "You're him." 

> "seethe your weapons. I said get drunk first before starting a brawl."

Elster: "What's wrong...?" she keeps looking back and forth at Erik and Horin

Horin stares at the bartender, his eyes squinting slightly as he tries to connect a few dots. "You have- This is your world. Your... Our nightmare... You are the reason we are here!" Horin looks around, trying to get a reference to anything that could be of use.

> Erik keeps looking at you, squinting more and more before it connects "OHHHHHH NOW I GET IT."

# OHHHHHH NOW I GET IT.

> "Wait wait no no I understand, I think."
> He gets to the middle of the tavern 
> **"AHEM, OKAY ALL OF YOU AS YOU CAN SEE WE GOT BUSINESS SO UHH, TO YOUR POSTS OR JOBS I DON'T CARE"**
>
>With that, everyone in the tavern gets up. The entire inn atmosphere dies and with various Aye sir and Yes boss they all leave in an orderly fashion.
>
>It's not only soldiers, even those that **look** like commoners or maybe even thieves reply like that. 
>Not even a minute, the tavern is empty.

"ᶦ ᶠᵘᶜᵏᶦⁿᵍ ᵏⁿᵉʷ ᶦᵗ" Horin mumbles under his breath, before placing his battleaxe's grip on the ground.

> "ALSO YOU, GET DOWN FROM THE STAIRS SHADOWFELL WIZARD."

FUCK HE KNOWS
ALRIGHT
SHIT

Elster looks up towards the wizard's voice and trembles slightly as she remembers him scaring the shit out of her
// fucking maniac

> He goes to lock the door. After he does so, he waves his hands and all the tables merge to a singular, nice marble table with gold accents. Around it, chairs with soft blue cushions appear, much more comfortable than the previous shoddy wooden chairs.
>
> "I will tell you in a bit, now sit."
> He grabs a sit himself "Anyone fancy any specific meal?"

He just materializes food lmao. Only food that he is able to make by himself normally.

**PIZZA IS CANON.**

*Niko's still having a very visibly thinking moment
"если еду можно вытаскивать магией, то зачем мы тогда занимаемся агрокулькурой? Если мы занимались агрокультурой, значит еду вытаскивать из ничего нельзя, значит... это не еда!"
This was not directed at anyone in particular and was said by niko to themselves, not particularly loud*
> 🔮oh Great Orb of Translation, reveal the meaning!
> "if you can pull food out of thin air, then why do we (niko's village) do farming? If we had to do farming, then it's not possible to pull food out of thin air, therefore... this is not food!"

Erik wakes up Beli in his room with **2 BUCKETS OF WATER.** 2. AND WAS READY FOR A THIRD. HOLY FUCK.

"this pizza be hitting different" i start eating it
Erik adds "Thanks g, I be makin them since my trip down to shadowfell bruv fr."
**PIZZA IS CANON.**

# BEGIN LORE DUMP

> "Okay, now that we are on good terms, I can finally start getting to the bottom of this."
> "But first, one more member must join us." he reaches into his pocket amd grabs a very familiar looking orb.
> He starts shaking it around "Come on, do the thing."
> After a bit of shaking and slamming on the table, the orb starts floating

Horin looks over at Erik. "Your... mannerisms are similiar, please excuse my abruptness."

> "Well then, like father like son I guess."

Bran: "Wait are you his what"

> "Yes, while hazy, that would be the most logical explanation."

> "Rick, your turn."
> You see 3 perpendicular lines move across the surface of the orb, splitting it in 8 corners. 
> These move outwards and form an area, within which the projection of a larger, spherical construct appears with 2 handlebars on the top and bottom and a large eye in the middle.

Beli: "But then how did we end up back in this world?"
"We fell and something happened then we were at the horrid lake"

> Erik adds "Same people who gave Elster some weird device, show them kid."

Elster finally withdraws her hands revealing two very visible handprints in the table and slowly takes the device in her hand and puts it on the table without a word.

> Erik looks at Elster depressed "As useless as ever, in essence the prof. looked at it and said that it is some device that detects spots of negative magic."
> "It has like, 2 weird meters on it and a knob. I have no idea how it works. Oh and a weird symbol on the back."
> "It's I think a circle with 3 arrows pointing into it and a spaced outline?"

> Notetaker's Note:
> THAT'S THE SCP LOGO. Confirmed by DM, this is an [Akiva radiation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-3493152/spikebrennan-s-proposal#post-3581256) meter." The characters dont know that, of course.

Horin takes and inspects the device.
it's like
a small thick notebook size
with the knob and 2 meters
and a crystal on the side

Beli: "And who might that be?"

> "So, either it is a dozen of them or very well hidden."

Beli: "So lemme make something clear, we need to stop Roko, but we have no, and I mean absolutely no, idea how to even start?"

> Erik says "In essence, from what Rick told me or else he will just sit here ponder you to oblivion. Your entire existence was to fix stuff."

Niko: "Yeah I can't make out a single thing about this device"

> "If I understand this correctly, you are a construct of Roko himself, made to fix issues within that world of hi- are you even listening?"

Niko: "yeah sorry"

> "Anyways, in essence you shouldn't be real."
>
> While Erik is talking, you see a weird aura eminating from Elster and, as she extends her arm, the weird device starts moving in a path towards her. The same path that it followed from when Horin took it to Niko.

Niko, putting the bulb onto the table: "If I were to be very specific he was not as much interested in talking to me as in taking this away from me"

"So you're saying my mother was not real?"

> Erik hushes Rick before he can say anything bluntly "It's tough to stomach but it's true. I am sorry kid."

Elle hearing this puts her hand on Niko's arm...

Beli: "You stole something from him that he needs? Way to go kid!"

Niko: "I never had a home..."
"my entire life, a fake, to serve a machine" 

Beli: "Hey hey, at least now you get to get back at him! Silver linings you know"

Niko: "get back for what? I was created to do a task I have been doing forever, again and again. I exist to fix..."

> "Okay, unlike the jukebox here I will keep it short. Past, now and future."
> "Pastl; after Roko did whatever he did to the worlds from my understanding they could not "support" themselves with the magic left so they all started merging, forming spots where you travel from one world to the other. You can go from a grassland to a desert to a tundra at a spot somewhere I heard within 100 meters."
> "Anyways, a few hundred years ago we figured out how to stabilize these spots and fast forward, a rail network was created to travel between them, now maintained by dwarves."
> "Now we go into the present; the railway here recently collapsed. This complicates things as the permit to continue work was never signed due to the controversial events taking place with the king, Bran already told you about it."
> "On top of that, getting to Shadowfell from here is an entire journey where at some point you will need to travel by boat a very angry sea. I hope you are ready for it."
> 
> "And by the time you reach that place, I hope the nations over yonder have dealt with their arguments or else you won't be able to go through the portal for it belongs to neutral ground."
> "Even shorter, it will be a pain. I'd ask the dwarves honestly if they can smuggle you through the rabble even. Or deal with the king, it's up to you."
> "As for the future, don't die."

Swag: "As for the future, this is based and all, but we do in fact die quite easily, and this sounds like a lot, no cap. Are we actually going to not die or what?"

> ".... probably you won't."
> "Best if you didn't if you are getting any "special" treatment by that guy's machinery."

Swag: "like fam we just went from "stop some bandits" to "save a couple worlds and travel between realities""

> "And I went from a pipsqueek to send a mountain to oblivion, you get used to it."

Swag: "I could get used to this."

Beli: "This is gonna suck, but I really need sleep now."

> "In any case, get to looking into it tomorrow, I need to fix this place so scram or else you will get caught between some celestial crossfire."

Niko: "once we get through the portal, what do we need to fix, exactly?"

> "Wᴇ ᴡɪʟʟ sᴇᴇ ᴏɴᴄᴇ ᴛʜᴇʀᴇ."
> He gets up and stretches "Alright, to your rooms preferable. And you too Elster, go to Cass' room and get to that job tomorrow."

We go to sleeb.

Elle is still staring at the void blankly.
Shaking, she says "I... I need air, I need to walk" 
and she goes for the door.
