# Start

The tablets lying around may or may not have been what powered the "no u" ability but its unclear. They COULD have been moved but were heavy.

Beli and Horin each carry a big crystal.
The rest get a few small pieces.

Horin says "For [[Rirka]]'s, dont do that!" when Niko has the big brain move of trying to break a crystal...

Our previous entrance is now... entirely gone!

Other than that, we spend an alarming time trapped in the previous battlemap, eventually figuring out our only option is hopping down a cave hole with water.
We called the cave Dave.

# We figured it out

We drop down.

There were 2 paths. We choose to move against the river, up the Dave.

We reach a turn in the cave. It keeps going left and up. There is also a crack in the wall -  a poorly dug out artificial hallway.

Getting up to here took about 10 minutes.

All spellcasters (everyone except Bran) have to do another spell save.

Beli and Swag fail, feeling a sharp headache that lasts 2 minutes. ^218f14

We choose to not risk it, and go up.

# We're so back

> You exit the cave and as your eyes adjust, you take notice of your surroundings.
> It is currently midday and you are in an open area.
> Very few trees in sight.
> The cave behind you sits on a large hill and in front of you is a cemetery. 

Daytime is consistent with when we entered.

We take a look at the cemetary.
> You pass by some of the more important looking ones Niko, specifically the ones that are those house-like structures where you can walk inside.
> Most of them appear to belong to the Anfroi family.

Other than that, a road leads to [[Sword's Hilt]].
Yeah we go there duh

# [[Sword's Hilt]], capital of Aurelia

> You reach the outskirts of the town, walking past the fields and barn houses.
> Frankly, even the ""slums"" outside of the walls seem proper, nicely maintained and posh.
> You see the farmers, various people loading carriages and such and also guard towers overlooking everything.

The farmers are still not yet used to the renaming of this city - it used to be called Eliomery.

> All of the houses still keep the architecture of Knife's Edge, however all of them appear to be much more maintained.
> To the point they all look refurbished and new.

We reach the open gate, and walk down the main road.

# Guards following Elster?

Guards around are questioning people.
One goes "THERE SHE IS!" and instead catches Niko.

Elster is over a manhole cover ready to dive into the sewers.

She chooses to escape.

Beli creates a distraction to stall several of the guards and figure out what to do.

**Niko yoinks the gold off of Horin, completely unnoticed. Basically all of the party's money.**

Horin instead goes to grab Elster for some reason.
"GET OVER HERE AND EXPLAIN YOURSELF!"

>Note:
>i think horin cast compelled duel on Elster? theres no mention of it in the chat unless im blind, did it happen through DMs? idk

What follows is a chase through the sewer between Horin and Elster, with Elster throwing Eldritch Blasts and Horin eating them for breakfast and eventually grabs her.
She continues to Eldritch Blast him nonstop, so he hits her and drops her unconscious.

He comes back up the sewer with her...

# HALT. IN THE NAME OF KING ANFROI THE 5TH DROP YOUR WEAPONS.

> As Horin comes out of the manhole and trying to diffuse the situation, more guards run towards you from the main road.
> "HALT. IN THE NAME OF KING ANFROI THE 5TH DROP YOUR WEAPONS."
> They move in to surround us.
> One of the guards ([[Aramil]]) step forward, dressed differently than the rest.
> He wears the typical guard uniform pants and shoes, however he only wears a black tshirt.
> His arms and neck are covered in various tatoos. Weirdly enough he seem to be unarmed.

Horin clears his throat, facing the one who spoke earlier and looking at his eyes. "May I question what is the meaning of this nonsense?"
As horin speaks, a large green glowing head and shoulders statue floats slightly above 
Horin's shoulders, behind him.

> He looks straight at Horin in the eyes and says "Oho, you wish to play like that? Very well."
> The officer strikes a pose and behind him, a spectral image of an equally buff dude with an eagle for a head appears behind him.

### TLDR:

the guards found Elster in a drug something something place, so they wanted to arrest her.

Aramil is super disappointed at the guards for "kidnapping one of his soldiers".

She was infiltrating an elusive drug cartel, and seemingly was succeeding!

Aramil is working with Erik.

# It's so joever

Ok so that just happened lmao
The situation is defused and the guards are starting to leave...
All except one. [[Ariane]]
> This female guard stands in front of you, barely any taller than you and stops your path.

Elster tries to go around her as she mumbles something

> She grabs you by the arm and, in a distorted but very familiar tone to you Elster she mutters "W̵̮̽h̸̓͜e̶̥̾r̷̗͌e̴̟͝ ̸͉̊d̴̋o you ṯ̷̈́ĥ̸͔i̴͔̍nk you ̶̣͂a̸͔͗re go͑ing?"
> You are eye to eye with the stranger. From within her helmet you can spot a few strands of pink hair and a wide-eyed expression that can only fit an absolute fucking maniac.
> 
> The female guard throws Elster back on the ground before removing her helmet.
> The stranger appears to be a a girl not much older than Elster. She has long pink hair and bright aqua eyes.
>
> Aramil turns around with his stand to point at the stranger "HEY YOU! IN THE NAME OF KING ALFROI THE 5TH WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE D-"
> "S̵̝̃h̶̓̎u̴͗͐t̷̆͐ ̵̓̒ů̸̌p̸̀͝"
> At that very moment, his stand disappears into thin air as he clutches his chest, barely able to breath.

As Horin casts Divine Sense,
> you break your concentration almost immediately as you have never felt such dedicated malice downright within one person alone. Such comparable determination you have only seen once in your life, instantly reminding you of Roko in every sense.

"What the fuck are you?"

"N̵̽̃o̴͝͝t̵̓͋ ̸̬̌ḿ̷͗u̸̾̀c̶͋h, just sticking to̴̐̈́ ̵̈́̈́t̵͆he plan âf̶̏̒t̶̋̆e̸r ̀m̷illennia."

Elster barely manages to turn over on her back and stares back right at her as she weakly says "A---r--ia-n--e-----"

# RUN

Horin grabs Elster.
We decide, perhaps, maybe, its wise to run, perchance, possibly.

We try to take a few shots at Ariane, they do nothing, she stops bolts mid air, teleports, levitates, stops whoever gets far enough...

As we run, vanta black holes with a silver lining that gradually get bigger and bigger start appearing into the sky.

Ariane wants Elster, but Horin holds on.

Beli throws his crystal at Ariane... who knows, when you have a button, might as well press it? Yeah no that does nothing

Niko sneaks off, successfully Assassins Creed climbing a building, getting to the roof.

Ariane is finally done with this shit, and freezes Horin mid air.
Elster lands on the ground a bit awkardly and stands up, looking up at Ariane while she quickly tries to twist her hands free out of the chains SHE STILL HAS ON FOR SOME FUCKING REASON BTW "Ariane- wa-it--"
"G̵͙̋ỉ̷̽v̶̓̔e̵͛͝ ̵̑͑m̷̌̚ē̷ a minutë́͒ ̶͆̔d̸̛́a̶rling.̶́̚"
Her sword telepathically moves up and slices your chains apart.

She lifts her arm as if grabbing Niko out of space and moving them closer.

And lets them drop on the ground.

Elster moves her hand towards the handle of the sword and pulls it towards her, lifting it up on her shoulder, staring up at Ariane expectantly
"O̵͑̀h̵̿͋,̵̑̅ ̴̽̈́t̶̉͛h̷̓̌a̸͘t complic̋͂a̴̋̚t̵̉́e̷s thin̸̄͒g̴̃̿s̶͌͝.̷͛"

She takes a jab straight into the greatsword, splitting it in half and pushing you back.
She picks up the other half of the sword.

Niko assassins creeds again and escapes from the party.
Unclear who, if any, saw him.

Her sentence is interrupted by a man slapping the shit out of Arianne, causing her to fall down in the process. [[Grigoriy]]
He is a well dressed gentleman "Now now, do not talk to my friends like that. Any friend of Erik really is a friend of mine as well."
So far his mannerisms and actions remind you of a more happy, upright and proper version of Erik. They are relatives.

He points his hand to one of the stores on the side of the road. As there is magic swirling within and around it, he asks calmly 
"While Erik is taking care of this problem down south, I would like all of you to get in there and let me handle the rest on this part of Aurelia."

Everyone remaining goes in the shop, Elster does so reluctantly.

The comets are rapidly approaching.

Elster: "Don't kill her, I want answers." she barks back as she struts over to the rest
 "Do not worry, I will not, I promise."
 "Anything for our cute little sister Elster, do not worry." 

As you step in, the door closes shuts behind you
The entire place starts vibrating rapidly before disappearing into thin air.
Out the window, it's a cosmic background that extends the cosmos.
