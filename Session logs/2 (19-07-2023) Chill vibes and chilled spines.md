# Recap

Continuing from [[1 (16-07-2023) Inexplicable Crew, Inexplicable Place|Session 1]], we are dropped in a lake.
For most of us at least. Some hit the nearby ground. And that girl was missing.
As the place seemed peaceful, or peaceful right now at least (there was evidence of murder or suicide deep in the lake), we went to gather things to make camp to rest a bit, including a campfire, tents and food (fish, berries). *don't ask me where the tents came from*
Some people bothered drying their belongings previously soaked by the trip through the lake, some didn't.
As night fell, we took turns to guard the camp. *you never know*
At the second guard turn shit happened. Surprised and shocked, one of our guards (Horin) shouted. Surprised by what? By the other guard being surprised and worried. Surprised by what? By the things that were now alerted by this shouting.
Shouting enough to alert those things but not to wake up the others. *How unfortunate...*
Some of the others were attacked just as they woke up, some before being really of sound mind.
$wag Messiah got dragged into the lake.
Meanwhile, Elle nearly dodged a creature that then fell into the campfire then fled before kneeling and yelling horribly. an alert or order of sorts, maybe?
Fire seems effective.
As Elle worked at lighting torches, Messiah was fighting against himself more than anything. now into the lake he lost the will to fight whatever was going on for a long moment. At the last minute, he found in himself enough to sort his thoughts, clear up whatever fog was cast on his mind and throw magical shocks supposedly toward the creature that dragged him. 
It must have worked well enough since he found his way back to the surface and then the shore.
We all got reunited and started organizing what to do next. Some talked of retaliation, of going fishing for the skeleton in the lake.

---

# Start

You fall into a lake.
The lake is in a forest clearing.

⚠️ **There are absolutely no trees inside the lake.**

The forest appears to be quite thin, with very tall trees that have large branches to form a uniform ceiling from which only a bit of light manages to pass through.
On one side is a steep cliff with a waterfall.
On the opposite side you see a where a river starts from the lake, flowing into the forest.
Fauna wise, you can see a many types of fish and some eels swimming around and about in the lake. You even spot some trying jump, trying to swim against the river's current.

[[Swag Messiah]] and [[Beliminorgath]] fell onto the ground next to the lake.

# Mostly Reunited

None of us know where this place is.

*Note:* "it has been QUITE LONG since you last ate anything and the hunger is starting to get to you"

we are all reunited, except [[Elster]] who is still missing (last seen in [[1 (16-07-2023) Inexplicable Crew, Inexplicable Place#HOW THE FUCK WAS THIS MANAGED THIS TIME AROUND]])

we make a camp, gather food.
chill, talk a bit.
short rest, even.
[[Swag Messiah]] exterminates all fish in the lake.
there is also [lober](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chBvksW4yQI). incredible. astouding.

**At the bottom of the lake, there is a skeleton.**
[[Horin]] in particular worries that this could be [[Elster]].
[[Bran Hornraven]] dives to inspect it.
There is a deteriorated rope tied to a rock. Not too far, the remains of the rotting skeleton on the lake's floor.
The bones are scattered and buried and he can't make much sense of it. **The skull, however, appears to be smaller than average.**
Searching for items or trinkets, he finds only a rusted dagger.

It is evening, and the group goes for a long rest.

# Rest: First shift: just a suspicion

Shift done by: [[Swag Messiah]] / [[Beliminorgath]]

[[Beliminorgath]] feels a chill down his spine.
"It's as if you are being closely watched. You immediately turn to look towards the waterfall, not managing to spot anything."
The rest of the shift is uneventful.

The night falls.

# Rest: Second shift: WHAT ARE THOSE.

Shift done by: [[Bran Hornraven]] / [[Horin]]

[[Beliminorgath]] wakes up both, and tells [[Bran Hornraven]] what he felt.
[[Bran Hornraven]], then looking at the waterfall - **confidently** sees nothing. (that was a nat 20 + 4)

The shift begins uneventfully.
Except.
At one point.
**The forest drops dead silent.**

They go investigate the woods.
[[Bran Hornraven]] first, finds an entity.
Just as he gets [[Horin]]'s attention, the creature scatters off.
> May or may not be relevant - but [[Horin]] had a torch.

[[Bran Hornraven]] whispers: "horin, did you see that? keep quiet"
Searching the treeline for whatever that was, [[Horin]] sees nothing, panicking.

[[Bran Hornraven]], however, sees SEVERAL of them hide behind trees.
He also HEARS many more than what he saw, around them.

> ℹ️Note: Highlighted noises!
> 
> Given that sound MAY have an importance in this encounter, anything loud is noted here, and is ==highlighted==.

[[Horin]] ==shouts==, holding his axe: **"Reveal yourself!"**

# The Horin incident.

[[Bran Hornraven]] understood silence matters. He starts going back to the tents, grabbing [[Horin]]. This ends up saving [[Horin]]:
one of those creatures was trying to pull him up the tree he was standing under, but Bran happened to hold him stronger than whatever that was.

==The clatter of armor and both of them falling== wakes the rest of the camp.

[[Horin]] ==shouts==: **"They're IN THE GOD DAMN TREES!!!!"**
He runs to the tents.

[[Beliminorgath]] ==groans loudly== before waking up.
[[Horin]] ==screams.==

[[Bran Hornraven]] is ALMOST attacked, but he hears the rustling of leaves above him and sidesteps just in time.

[[Swag Messiah]] ==screams==: **"THEY'RE IN THE WHAT"**
[[Beliminorgath]] ==yells at the top of his lungs==: **"GET THE FUCK BACK TO CAMP AND AWAY FROM THE FOREST LINE"**

Simultaneously, [[Swag Messiah]] and [[Solveig]] are being attacked... (more on that later) ^e03c1f

[[Beliminorgath]] ==starts playing his bagpipes as loud as he can== to see if it has any effect on the entities.
[[Cedric]] wakes up QUIETLY.

# The Elle incident, part 1.

[[#^e03c1f|When the attack started]]
A creature bolts straight from the forest, going for a frontal impact with her.
She is lucky: both her and the creature trip, and its hand grazes the campfire. 
It runs back into the forest, with a ==loud screech==.

[[Bran Hornraven]]: "fire. they fear fire"

That creature SUDDENTLY stops in its tracks after re-entering the trees.
Knees down, "arms" on its head, ==it wails in pain, the sound almost deafening you==.
[[Bran Hornraven]], [[Swag Messiah]] and [[Horin]] get the Fear status effect. ^55a86f

# The Swag incident.

[[#^e03c1f|When the attack started]]

A roll by DM selects [[Swag Messiah]] and [[Solveig]] as targets.

Advantage dex save. **Fail.**
As [[Swag Messiah]] wakes up, he suddently feels a tug on his ankle, is knocked down prone and dragged towards the lake.

Wisdom saving roll for [[#^55a86f|Elle's attacker wailing]]. **Fail.**
He is afraid.

Dex save. **Fail.**
He fails to secure any form of stable footing, and is dragged into the lake.

None of the group saw Swag get grabbed.

Con save. **Fail.**
His vision starts to fade.
As the water settles, a feeling of calmness starts to wash over him.

Con save. **Fail.**
As it gets darker and darker, it all feels too familiar.
The sounds and images of the lake fade with the ones of the past, reminding him again of back then, standing side by side his fellow mages, feeling the same feeling of your life being drained.

The creature rolls good to keep grabbing him (i assume)

[[Cedric]] rolls perceptions. **Fail.**

Con save. **SUCCESS.**
He comes to terms with his fate, as he did back then.
He comes to the sudden realization that, in fact, this is not the same.
Back then, whatever it was **he wanted it.**
**HE** had agreed to it.
### HE WAS READY FOR IT AND HE CHOSE IT.

As the hallucinations merge with reality, he suddenly takes a good look at the skeleton [[Bran Hornraven]] was talking about.
Taking a good look at it, he does not care if it is real or not - but the gang signs the skeletons throws at him gives him one last ounce of strength to gather his thoughts and manage to shoot a lightning bolt straight down, paralyzing whatever the fuck it is in the process.

As it lets go, Messiah swims to the shore as fast as his lightning.
He is out of the lake. Alive.

*Perception check. **Fail.***

# They're (maybe) gone

Right about when Messiah emerged from the lake, [[Solveig]] is just standing there, knowing very well something was behind her.

She turns back with her 3 lit torches and tries to take a look.
The creature's back is centimeters away from her. Staring into the lake.
After few seconds, it turns around and runs into the forest.

# Discussing what to do about the situation

The creature from [[#The Swag incident.]] was never actually seen to leave.

[[Swag Messiah]] ==screamed maybe twice.==

[[Bran Hornraven]]: "Did anyone else get any kind of look on what these creatures were?"
[[Solveig]]: "One thing I know is they seem to have four jaws that open like a flower"
[[Bran Hornraven]]: "perhaps there were several different creatures, the one I saw was like a deer"

[[Bran Hornraven]], in reference to the creature he saw, asking if [[Cedric]] if he knows of it: "have you at least got anything on a deer that walks on its hind legs with antlers pointing downards?"
[[Cedric]]: "Nought that is not found outside the underdark, unless it could be demons or devilspawns. Prithee, [[Solara]] save us if that is the case."

"Even on the battlefield, I did not know this... feeling. The feeling of death was common, sure, but the feeling of... dread? That's new. The feeling of not being able to defend, kill or even manage to see the enemy. The feeling of.... Uselessness. Perhaps the shadow person is torturing us this way?" [[Horin]] sighs, chucking a stone into the campfire.

The group is uncertain on how to act:
resting, building defences, continuing to watch, even arson was mentioned.
Many are not ready to sleep anytime soon.

At the very least, now the group has established what they think is adequate safety.

# End of session.
