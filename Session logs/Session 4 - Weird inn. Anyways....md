# Recap

In the inn, we wake up and meet Erik, the man that works there.
We also find Niko, a cat looking child that apparently already met with Elle.

We converse a bit, finding out more about this new acquaintance that seems is going to stick with the group, have breakfast...

Erik leaves, going to the kitchen. Bran, just in case, decides to follow and investigate.
He enters the kitchen: nothing happened, in fact he is caught trespassing by Erik and asked to go back where hes supposed to be.
Bran does have an impression that an illusion was cast on a wall of the kitchen, while he was leaving.

Some time passes, we continue to talk, and...

A loud BANG comes from the kitchen.
This time, almost the entire group goes to investigate.

We find the illusion: it was hiding a door in the back of the kitchen.
Opening that door brought us to Cedric's room. (Cedric, who, by the way, was absent because he is asleep from extreme skoomation)
We played around a bit with this spatial paradox, testing it,eventually we got bored of it and returned to breakfast.

Erik eventually exits from the same magic door, slightly pissed that we're going places we arent supposed to.

It's not too bad, we are able to still chat a bit, and ask about whats going on around this village, he tells us 2 quite important details:
- The underground tunnels connecting the 5 regions here with the rest of the planes had a collapse.
- At the same time the king fell ill and now his god forsaken son is in his place

He then shows us Elster's orb asking if we know what it is.
After we kind of give away our involvement, he realizes something about us, and all of a sudden, avoids the topic and leaves.

Then, the owner of the inn, Cassandra, who previously already met Elle, arrives and asks everyone in the inn to leave.
She says we'll have to discuss... sometime.

We leave, think about what just happened, and decide what to do next.
We choose that we need some shopping.

We go to the guild offices to buy some equipment, especially for Niko who didnt have any tools.

# Start

> As I was saying, some of you had a good sleep, others decided to turn into marble by drinking gallons up gallons of skooma.
> Your sleep however [[Horin]] was plagued by a nightmare. As you lay prone on the floor everything was hazy and blurry. Only thing you could make out was someone standing there with a vinyl disk in his hand and scratching it slightly with a bayonet, all while wearing an evil grin on his face. 
> As morning comes the light shining through your windows slowly wakes everyone up.

> As you go down, you see [[Erik]] standing by behind the bar counter, looking quite bored.
> To give you a description, Erik is a man roughly 170cm tall with a roundish face, brown eyes and blondish-brown curly hair that drop right before his shoulders. He wears a crimson red linen shirt with a breastpocket, formal pants and nice shoes. On his right index finger he has a thick silver ring with a purple gemstone.

The party wakes up, and starts breakfast.
[[Niko]] is here: except for [[Elle]], this is the first time the party sees them.

Seeing that [[Cedric]] and [[Elle]] havent woken up yet, [[Swag Messiah]] makes a half assed decision to use lightning noise right there to wake them up.
The spell is instantly prevented from being cast by [[Erik]].

While discussing [[Niko]]'s cat ears / NOT A CAT BY THE WAY,  
[[Niko]]: "well I don't know, I am just a person. Where I'm from most of us look like that!"

[[Elle]] now wakes up, and goes with the rest of the group.

[[Bran]]: "Ah, morning elle. This child here says they know you?"

[[Niko]] *turns 180deg* "Elle!"

[[Elle]]: "yes, we met yesterday. a stray, like us"

> Erik turns to you to inform the tavern "I am sorry but if you need me I will be at the back. Something urgent has arisen." and he leaves with an angry pace.

# ERIK'S PROBABLY DYING!!1!1!!

[[Bran]] decides to stealthily investigate what's going on with Erik.
He sneaks by behind the bar and opens the door located there. He has a clear look into the kitchen but there is no-one there.

He continues to move through the kitchen sneakily, looking for clues as to what's going on...
As he walks through the kitchen, he feels a tap on his shoulder, from behind.
It's [[Erik]]: "May ask what you are doing back here?"

*Meanwhile the rest of the group is still eating, chatting, getting to know [[Niko]]...*

[[Bran]]: "Checking to see if you're alright. I've seen enough fine barmen extorted by criminals to know when something might be up."

[[Erik]] looks at him with the most blank face imaginable...
"I assure you traveler, criminals are the last kind that would pass by here. So if you please go out front, I will be with you shortly if you need anything."

As Bran leaves the kitchen, he has no insight on what Erik's true intentions are. But he does get an impression, that an illusion was cast on a wall of the kitchen.
He returns to the bar acting naturally as if nothing happened.

# ok no he's fine (also, more Niko exposition)

[[Niko]], in reference to [[Swag Messiah]] *indirectly* introducing his name:
"Messiah? Like myself?"
"Sir Messiah have you saved a world yet?"

[[Beliminorgath]]: "Wait you what, you saved a world?"

[[Niko]]: "I have! Many more times than I can remember. It was always the same world though..."

[[Beliminorgath]]: "Impressive, very impressive. I a- was but a simple farmer."

[[Niko]]: "My mom is a farmer! We live on a farm."
"uh, lived"
"I think she... died. Yesterday."

the people around are saddened by this. duh

[[Niko]]: "my entire world is go-one-e"

[[Beliminorgath]]: "Hey buddy it's alright, I'm sure it's not permanently gone."

> [[Erik]] comes out of the back with [[Elle]]'s order. As he leaves the food on the table he stares at [[Niko]].

[[Niko]]: "It exploded"

Niko shows the lämp, Beli asks what it is...

[[Niko]]: "it's the SU-UN!, it was very important when I was saving the world"
"The world I woke up in had it's sun on a biig tower break, and I had to bring a new one!"

[[Beliminorgath]]: "You only had a lighthouse for a sun?"

[[Niko]]: "No-o the tower was very-y tall and it lit up the entire world"
"At home we have a sun like here, it's in the sky"

# HE'S DYING FOR REAL THIS TIME WE MUST SAVE HIM

> As you speak with each other, you hear a loud BANG shortly followed by a metallic crash on the wall, coming from the kitchen.

*[[Niko]] meows. not a cat by the way*

[[Horin]] doesn't flinch at the sound, slowly just looking over at the kitchen's door before sighing. "You okay in there, barkeep!?" He shouts.  
There is no response.

The group decides to go investigate the kitchen. [[Beliminorgath]] remains outside.

[[Bran]] sees nothing different from before.

> as you walk into the kitchen you can see it's very shiny. Marble walls, tiled sterile floor. Central aisle with various pots and pans in different stages of cooking a large assortment of meals.
> on the walls you see sinks, counters and shelves with various ingredients
> All in all, seems like a kitchen that one man would not run himself.

[[Niko]] casts Detect Magic.

> Niko raises their lamp and as it shines bright, the entire room fills with light. Immediately they understand that the entire room is filled to the brim with magic more than usual. After a bit the bulb's brightness lowers and instead brights towards a specific spot on the far back wall.
> *note: niko sees this*

> As you touch the wall, suddenly the illusion breaks and a door is revealed

[[Beliminorgath]]: "Anything happen?" I shout from the main room

[[Bran]]: "We've found a door, magically concealed"
"Wanna go through it?"

[[Beliminorgath]] downs the abandoned wine glass in one fell swoop, then joins the group: "Why not right? We've come this far" 

# The Funny Door™️

> The door opens and as you go through it...
> You are in one of the inn's rooms.

What would normally be the exit to the room, is now open towards the kitchen.

> In an instant you see Cedric, passed out in his bed.
> Not dead...
> Instead you quickly realize what is going on when you see a lot of green bottles littering the floor.

SKOOMA.

[[Horin]] smacks [[Cedric]]. "Wakey wakey, you've slept for too long."
NO REACTION.

[[Niko]]'s peeking in: "Who's that?"

[[Elle]]: "that's Cedric, one of us"

[[Niko]]: "I don't know why but he reminds me of my father, somehow..."

[[Horin]] sighs and wraps [[Cedric]] up in the blanket, making them cocooned into a burrito. "They're still asleep."

[[Beliminorgath]]: "I have an idea, could someone who knows which room Cedric is in run up to it through the corridor upstairs?"
"I wanna go find out what happens if we enter it from the outside"

[[Bran]]: "We've just defied every law of geometry...what the hell is this place"
"And when are we going to get out"

[[Elle]] and [[Beliminorgath]] leave, go up the stairs, reach what would be Cedric's door from the outside.
It is closed.

[[Beliminorgath]] knocks on the door from the outside with force.
The rest of us inside the room can hear it.

*Niko goes back to the dining area, and looks around for a bowl of gems from yesterday*
*They steal 2 gems.*

The group now leaves the room and regroups. Everyone is now in the kitchen.

# hah whoops he was fine all along

> So for you being in the kitchen, the door that was hidden by the illusion opens and Erik steps into the room

[[Erik]]: "As I said to your seaman fellow over here, may you STOP please going where you are NOT supposed to be?"

[[Elle]]: "sorry about that, we were well intended. there was this loud explosion noise and we were worried"

[[Bran]]: "Perhaps you could tell us why there's a magical hidden door to our friend's room"
"Not exactly the promised level of privacy is it?"

> He looks at you with the same blank stare. After pondering about an answer "....maybe you could keep throwing darts in the dark.... one is bound to hit at some point."

[[Bran]]: "So...you don't know about it? In your own inn?"

[[Erik]]: "No I know about it, it's not a door to your friends room. Well.. was. Now it's not. Observe."

> He opens the door and reveals a small hallway with 2 more doors "See?"
> He closes the door again "Now if you can, please step out of the kitchen."

[[Bran]]: "We shall trouble you no further if that's your wish"
"but I'd keep a closer watch on magical doors if I were you"

[[Erik]]: "Argh, listen pal. I know sea travelers like you don't see this stuff often but do me a favor. I do not get paid enough anyways to explain it to you."
"Just do not snoop around too much. General rule."

[[Niko]] looks around, and after grabbing the bulb tries to sneak past Erik into the main dining area.

[[Erik]]: "Oh and on top of that, since you were wondering about the king. We have had some shortcomings with that and we are kind of embarrased about his successor, that is why nobody talks about him."

[[Bran]]: "Ah, nothing too out of the ordinary then" 
"Foolish princes are found the world over"

[[Erik]]: "Brother, he named the village Knife's Edge for crying out loud."

Meanwhile, [[Horin]] is just standing around awkwardly next to Messiah and Beli. "Soooo.... Swag, where exactly does your... magic come from?"

[[Swag Messiah]]: "my RINNNGS. each one is a spell.
and i've had good teachers back home."

[[Niko]] knows zoomer speech fr fr no cap

> As you all leave, he follows close behind.

Beli: "Hey Erik, how annoyed are you at us?"

Erik: "I can't be bothered to be as annoyed, though you are a select few to try and mess around with my tavern in general."

# Erik knows part of what happened in Session 1

Bran: "So what's this region like? And what's going on with the king?"

Erik: "To give you the short story. ==The underground tunnels connecting the 5 regions here with the rest of the planes had a collapse. At the same time the king fell ill and now his god forsaken son is in his place==." ^17add0

Bran: "Fascinating...we all met trapped in a collapsed tunnel, I suspect between the planes"
"The king's illness, is it natural do you think?"

Erik: "Can't help you there. ==I am not in the military."== ^f0a708

Bran: "Interesting. How did you come to run this inn?"

Erik: "It's a friend's. She is absent most of the time with work so I step in from time to time."

Beli: "Your friend seems talented in the way of magic, that door is very impressive"

Erik: "Thanks, it tends to be useful."
"Now gentlemen, and lady... and child. I have a question for you."
==He pulls a weird orb from his breast pocket "Does any one of you have any idea what this?"==

> It is indeed Elster's orb.

Elle: "it looks like that orb she was wearing, the one that opened..."

Bran: "it definitely is."

Elle: "honestly I don't know what it did"

Beli: "Something for sure"

Bran: "That orb belonged to a friend we lost...how did you come by it?"

> He stares at you for a bit
> Then back at beli
> Then at the orb
> And goes back and forth until it stops and his face is like a few key thoughts clicked
> ".......ooooooohhhhhhhhh........."

Horin tilts his head. "Please do elaborate."

Erik: "Nevermind then, do not worry about that."

Beli: "No no, yes we mind that, what?"

Erik: "If you excuse me I have that unfinished business in the back." says as he clutches the orb in his hand with quite a lot of force and paces back to the kitchen in a hurry.
He locks the door behind him and can't be followed.

None of us have any insight on his intentions.

Niko: "What was that necklace?"

Elle: "something our missing person was wearing"

Swag: "Another kid we met... Wait, you both have orbs?"

Niko, concerned: "another kid?"

Beli: "Oh yeah, when we all were transported to the same place a child was there with us too, we got separated shortly after"
"They seemed to have some connection to whatever was there with us, some weird metal entities"

Niko: "Well I certainly hope that is not a repeating pattern"
"Machines! They were flying and walking right? I've met some when I was saving a world, some even looked like me, a bit"

# Cassandra arrives

> a woman enters the bar.
> Elle and Niko you recognise her, it's Cassandra.

Elle goes to meet her, Niko hides behind Beli.

> She hurries over to you who are trying to open the door behind the bar counter "Hi loves sorry to interrupt but Erik called me here. I am the owner of the tavern and uhm... I'd like to ask you to leave for a moment alongside all other patrons."
> "There are some things we need to discuss."

Beli: "I wouldn't mind listening"

Bran: "There are some things I'd like to discuss too"

Horin frowns towards her. "Your... Erik... Has one of our friend's belongings. One of our... MISSING friends belongings."

> She turns to you with a concerned look "....I would however. Please." she asks politely.

*Niko is quite well hidden apparently*

Elle, giving up on her bread,
"if it's related to Elster and the orb, it kinda concerns us too. but we can wait I guess"

Cassandra: "I have no idea who you speak of and what this "orb" is but it's not something related. If you have any problems like that you best take it up with the guard."

Horin begrudgingly sighs. "Do ask your friend about the... orb in his pocket, ma'am." He then follows Beliminorgath and the others.

*The group decides to leave for now.*

As Beli gets outside he sets down the child "Sorry buddy, didn't get good vibes from the situation"
"So uhm, who or what was that?"

Elle: "Cassandra. the owner, it seems"

Bran: "looked like you met her before elle"

Elle: "we did, yesterday."

*Niko begins to just ramble*
"сначала тут взорвут, потом кинут, теперь магия херакия повсюду, да такая что двери открываются против законов физики, ну куудааа меня занееслоо!"
> 🔮oh Great Orb of Translation, reveal the meaning!
> "first that explodes, then I fly, now there's magi-dicking all over the place, and so much that the doors opens against the laws of physics! Awhws wheere did I end up! "

# Now that you are kicked out of the tavern, what do you do

The group continues to try to understand what the heck just happened.

Elle, referring to Erik and Cassandra: "I've got a feeling they have a side gig in the back. and Erik seemed to understand the orb's relevance."

The group decides to go shopping:
we need a better way to carry the unconscious Cedric around, 
a map,
Niko needs some basic things...

The whole group goes to the guild offices.
We follow Elle, who has been there before.

# The guild shops

> As you go to the second floor you end up in a large corridor, lined with different shops. Quickly you realize that these shops are specialized. A place for guild artisans to display and sell their wares.
> There is mostly everything, from leatherworkers and blacksmiths to alchemists and jewelers

we buy stuff :)

we dont buy these:
jeweler has 3 magic rings:
- ring of the ram: 5500g
- ring of warmth: 1700g
- ring of featherfalling: 3000g

Elle: "so you told me magic items sales were highly regulated. but is that true of all items, even those not sold? like, a traveler comes into town with their own possessions, you know?"

> "Law of the 5 nations does not forbid travelers from bringing in their own magic items. Of course checks are done at the borders. In general do not go waving them around."

Elle: "ah. that leads to question about magic usage then. how are magic users seen here? is using magic common?"
"I mean, you do have artificers kits for sale so it can't be forbidden, but..."

> "Oh yes, magic is quite common. Nothing wrong about that."

# End
