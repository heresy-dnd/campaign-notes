# Start

We sleep normally, except...

> For Horin and Niko however, your sleep was plagued with awful nightmares.
> The only thing you can remember is lying down on the floor, hurt and exhausted, looking up to a man next to a record player holding a knife and a vinyl disk that was had more cuts and stabs on it than engraved grooves.

We take our breakfast, and Erik tells us what we can do next:

>  "Right, as we were saying. The professor had a job for the slightly autistic one but she is currently in a world of her own so..."
>  "You get to do it." he says with a snarky tone

We are concerned at the fact that we have to return in the woods where we were attacked by [[SCP looking mf]], since our destination is the cave we skipped in [[Session 3 - Civilization!#Departure]].
Erik doesnt see what the problem is, saying that forest is peaceful.

# Departure

A bit paranoid, we move through. Nothing out of the ordinary - until Niko notices a worrying amount of scratch marks in the trees.
Furthermore, they appear to be going in the same direction as we are. They are ahead of us.

We get to the cave just fine.

Niko again examines the entrance and notices that at least 5 or 6 creatures recently exited the cave.

Swag casts Alarm on the cave's entrance.

# Descending through the cave

> As you keep walking deeper and deeper, it is also getting considerably colder.

We all have to do a **save with our spellcasting skill**.
Swag fails.

> As you keep walking deeper and deeper, it has been roughly 5 minutes since you entered and it's quite cold.
> After a certain point, Messiah you feel a slight headache at random that does not last for long.
> Another thing you all start realizing is that it has gotten a bit windy.

Swag mentions that the alarm must have been set off, but this appears to be the side effect of going through the portal: [[Session 8 - CHAOS#^218f14]]

We start seeing natural light!

> You reach a dead end. In front of you is a steep cliff and looking up, you can see the sky.
> The cold winter air is coming into the cave from here, the breeze is much stronger.

We get out of the tunnel and into the battle map.

# Fight

We first meet a couple satyrs.
One could summon a memphit

Eventually, "a giant crystalline wyrm" lands in the scene and eats 1 satyr, prompting the rest to fuck off immediately.

> Description we got later:
> "Not very lizard-like considering it was a young wyrm that had just sprouted it's wings."

We fight it, it had this cool "no u" ability, it dies, we win.

We break off the crystals from its back.
