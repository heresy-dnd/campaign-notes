# Recap

You are all, for different reasons, falling through some sort of void dimension. It feels like it has been forever and you keep reminiscing and wondering how you failed and ended up like this...

We all suddenly appeared sprawled in an old tunnel in some kind of facility.
Some went exploring this tunnel while others cared for the mentally broken girl who wasn't ready to walk.

We unlocked a half-broken door.

Exploring further, the mentally broken girl accidentally got thrown down a catwalk onto a pile of machines _related to how her mind went broke of course_, which _of course_ started turning on.
We were all expecting a fight, but they were peaceful.
Peaceful, but intent on making us do something in particular. We obliged.

Some sort of machine based ritual involving an artifact the girl was wearing.
She managed to activate the thing, which activated a robot, which more or less suggested we were fucked in multiple ways and notably with how some few millions of years passed but also how he started some ominous process.
The process in question may or may not have been to invoke the facility's owner.

He interrupted something, broke machines, bullied people, was clearly god-tier OP af, there was no point killing ourselves resisting.
On a whim, he decided to throw us back to the void with a challenge to "entertain" us while he did his "very important" things.

We won relatively easily and only with non-combat related casualties.
Big asshole came back to verbally abuse us some more before throwing us from the bossfight platform into some portal that seemed to drop us into a lake.

# Start - Campaign Introduction

> _It has been incredibly long, perhaps and eternity since you forgotten what had happened to you. Floating in an endless, dark void, you people have started to doubt if you even remember who you are._
> *That being said, you would probably have forgotten already had there not been these repeating memories playing in your head like a broken record.*
> 
> *For you [[Horin|Horin]], it's like yesterday you were preparing for that assault against the cultists. You still remember the faces of your comrades, all cheerful and ready to retake their homeland. Could not hide the heavy atmosphere however since most, if not all, did come to terms with the fact most of them would not be coming alive a long time ago.*
> *If only you knew what would cause such a great rapture and make everyone fall deep down into that wretched chasm, your plan would have been perfect. And now you're here.*
> 
> *From your part [[Beliminorgath|Beliminorgath]], every living day you've spend prior to being thrown in this wretched place have slowly molded into one. You'd relive in your head the same day of waking up, helping around the farm, running for chores in the nearest village and practicing your bagpipes when you had free time.*
> *Yet every time you recall this simple life always ends with the same nightmare. All out warfare against an impossible foe where every time it ends with them breaking down the door to your farmhouse and charging in.*
> 
> *As for you [[Swag Messiah|Messiah]], you still remember yourself standing shoulder to shoulder with every mage from every corner of the world. Coming close to the end of the war, every single one of you made it their goal to make sure that whatever that hellish giant construct which dared disturb the order and piece of your lands would be once and for all sealed in the demiplanes of heaven and hell to the point where it was forgotten and removed entirely from the history books.*
> 
> *Your fate [[Bran Hornraven|Hornraven]] is not less tragic than the rest. After doing various odd jobs from killing small fry that owe to loansharks to stealing weapons from officers, you managed to secure enough money for you to find a ship and a small crew.*
> *Having heard time and time again, you managed to track down the location of the legendary sword of ..... not that you ever cared. You just knew deep down it would fetch a very high price.*
> *After setting off, you finally once again felt at home. You have finally answered the call of the oceans you used to travel every day. Turns out this trip would not last very long.*
> *Approaching the presumed location of your prized booty, your ship was demolished with one quick strike of the tentacle from this monster.*
> *You knew, you still know to this day however that this is not some mythological creature of the seas. You were too confident in your abilities to take down anything. But deep down you could not have defeated such a beast even with your old ship and crew. Wouldn't even stand a chance.*
> 
> *When it comes down to you [[Cedric|Cedric]], your days would also not be very much different than each other, yet more intriguing than anything else. Every day you'd manage to learn or discover something you when it came down to the stars, the powers bestowed upon you by [[Solara]].*
> *On a stary night you'd be studying the various constellations with your telescope from your tower when you suddenly noticed a storm of falling stars engulfing the skies.*
> *Quickly averting your gaze to start noting this exceptionally rare phenomenon in your journal, your eyes focus on the town far down the valley from your window.*
> *It was set ablaze, or whatever was left of it for half the city now belonged to the crater next to it.*
> *Quickly getting down from your tower to go and help those still hanging in there, you don't manage to take many steps out of your tower as the last thing you remember was one of those falling stars coming straight towards you, splitting into a thousand pieces just before impact.*
> 
> *In your case [[Elle|Solveig]], you've tried to forget. All this impossibly long time you've been trying to forget everything you've heard, and everything you saw.*
> *All your life you've been thinking this power of yours to look into pathways in between the realms was a gift, when it quickly became a curse once you took one step into one wrong pathway you should never have known it even existed.*
> *Being taken over by curiosity, you'd sneak very carefully into this weird plane, despite all the efforts from your retainer to stop you. You should have heard honestly. But you could never imagine you'd be 5 steps in and already walking over a metallic catwalk positioned roughly 5 meters above a boiling cauldron of thousands, if not millions of souls.*
> *Not being able to hold back, you let out a scream in fear as the poor souls of the damned wail under you in pain. This scream of yours though caught the attention of something, no, someone far worse than every war that has happened and will ever happen combined.*
> *Turning to face you at the edge of a catwalk you see the dark, shadowy figure of a man where the only destinguishalbe features are his glowing eyes and the armored gauntlets he is wearing.*
> *As he covers the distance between the two of you in a single step, you have no time to react and look up as he grabs you by the neck of your shirt and throws you in the cauldron to meet your fate with the rest. As for the last thing you remember, it's him slowly pacing towards the open pathway you came from and leaving to the other side.*
> 
> *The last one, and probably most unfortunate one of you all, is you [[Elster|Elster]].*
> *You truly have been useless your entire life.*
> *You never managed to accomplish anything outstanding. From your position, even accomplishing the most mundane every day tasks deserved a praise.*
> *If it was not for that damned orb hanging around your neck and your dear friend Ariane from the village, nobody would be surprised, not even bat an eye if you offed yourself.*
> *Every day you'd be bullied by your peers from the other noble families by day and go to sleep with that God awful Regent by night. Was it not for the condescending, yet reassuring at times, you'd have lost your mind. Not like you didn't lose it in the end.*
> *Last things you manage to remember was while being waterboarded by the next in line from some other noble house you'd grab a glimpse of **the orb** violently glowing white off tones as you saw the vision of a man staring down at you from above the fountain every time they dunked your heard in. You faintly managed to hear him say "Th- -m ac-er-es".*
> *At that moment it is as if everything stops, the world drowned in shades of gray.*
> *As he picks you up out of the fountain and drops you a bit off to the side, you see a man looking down on you with bright white eyes and very ornate metallic gauntlets and he tells you in a very familiar condescending tone "Now that he is is out of the way dumbass, you were not that useless after all."*
> *"You have managed to accomplish what I hoped your family should have achieved in the past 4 generations by getting your ribs kicked in time and time again, truly a remarkable feat."*
> *Now I just need to get that orb back and I can finally finish this plan, and it's not like you can put up much of a fight anyways. Well, it does not have to stop here really. How about we work together for a bit. Let me finish the job I am supposed to do and then I will let you be on your way. What do you say?"*
> *As those final words exit this man's mouth he extends his hand towards you with a wide grin as if he is waiting for you to accept his pyramid scheme business proposal.*
> *But having nothing else to lose, you accepted anyways. And oh boy as bad if not worse than a pyramid scheme it quickly became.*
> *Shaking his hand you quickly feel all the life drain out of you as you are forced to look the man in the eyes. And after that it's a haze.*
> *After that it's all a weird mismatch of moments. You looking down examining your hands and new found powers. Pacing through the streets of your neighborhood, closely examining the chaos that ensued from people being shot on the spot to women and children being dragged out of their homes from giant stacks of metal.*
> *You remember the downfall of everything from the school you were to attend, to the village you'd sit in a warm hug under a tree with your dear friend, only now you'd hold their bloodied body in their arms.*
> *All these images follow the same pattern until you feel the cosmic battle taking place inside of you lead you under the stars in a demolished building's clearning and all fading into the void you find yourself in now.*


# Thrown into a cave

> As everyone's time at purgatory runs short, you feel your bodies being ripped out of that world.
> Ripped is not the right word here, more like forcefully exiled and you find yourselves slamming down on hard paved tiles.
> You find yourself in what you assume to be a tunnel.

# Not the bees


We enter a room, with a catwalk.
[[Horin]] is carring [[Elster]], doesnt see a pipe coming down from the ceiling, she drops down the catwalk 5 meters onto a machine.

It wakes up, looks at her necklace, changes its eye color from white to deep blue and turns itself off.

[[Elster]] recognizes it - as the machines that would go in their homes and drag people out.
"t-the-y wi-ll d-dr-ag us ou-t- li-ke----"
She does NOT want to be here. Nope.

A small light then starts blinking on it.
The room has shelves of parts and similarly looking [[Name Unknown - Bee assistant robots]].
The floor is littered with constructs like the one [[Elster]] fell on top of.

The light on the construct starts blinking in a rythm.
The [[Name Unknown - Bee assistant robots]] start blinking in sync.
They light up green, energy flows from the top to the bottom of them.
They all take flight.

[[Horin]] holds [[Elster]] at the creatures.
They stop their dance and stare at the child.
She's fucking terrified.
They turn at eachother and nod.

Many panels open at the walls and they scatter in the holes.
All except one, that comes TOO close to [[Elster]], and points at a newly opened door.

# Pillars and a socket

> You move through the door
    In the room you see several structures that the robots have flocked around off. Tall pylons arranged in a circular pattern they seem to be trying to repair.
> In the middle of the pylons, there is a receptacle with a projection of a spherical item that looks very familiar to [[Elster]].

It looks just like the orb on her necklace.

The machines seem to be doing work on the structure.

She's EXPONENTIALLY TERRIFIED and in shock.
Eventually, [[Elster]] wins over her fear: gets down to the ground, and starts walking to the receptacle, her necklace in hand.
She puts it in the machine.

The orb floats toward its place. It then falls on the floor.
White light washes over the room, lights up the pillars.

Tons of [[Name Unknown - Bee assistant robots]] appear and swarm up in the ceiling.
The floor starts to open.
They sit down on the floor.
A new construct emerges.

# Roko?

The construct grabs the orb, and gives it back to [[Elster]].

[[Useless Stewart]]: "Roko, sir, it has been a very long time. We have been waiting for you."
"After your plan failed sir on a large scale we could not figure out how to continue and... well and, don't be mad but chaos ensued and everything crumbled."
The party doesnt interrupt the robot.
"... Sir? Sir are you alright?"

[[Bran Hornraven]]: "Roko is fine, just a little tired. Nothing to worry about!"

[[Useless Stewart]]: "Sir you do look a lot smaller that is true. The database however does match this girl with the one from Ǹ̴͐^̷̳͌ǐ̶̖(̸̈̐1̶͐̆2̸̀͝9̷̌2367492̉8̶̇̈)̶̒̂."

[[Elster]]: "R-rok-o..?"

[[Useless Stewart]]: "Why yes Sir, have you forgotten your name?
Well according to my interal clock it has indeed been arou-"

It turns off briefly, calculating.

"41 galactic years and 2 days since you disappeared Sir."

[[Bran Hornraven]]: "Yes, it's been a rather long time but we've brought Roko back for you."

[[Useless Stewart]]: "Sir, may I ask what these creatures are doing here with you and why are they not inhabitting the plane?"

[[Elster]]: "h-hold on... how m-much is a galactic year exactly...?"

[[Useless Stewart]]: "HAHA Sir oh please, when did you gain a sense of humor. Someone as great as you would know that essentially 9430 million years have passed since then."

> This conflicts with the DM saying that it corresponds to 230 million earth years.
> Is the robot talking in a different type of year?

[[Bran Hornraven]]: "We're friends of roko, made over those galactic years, nothing untoward I assure you - though we would like transportation back to the plane if you could help us with that..."

The deception check fails.

[[Useless Stewart]]: "Oh my Goodness Sir! I have told you time and time again to not overwork yourself over planning. Also-*Are you in danger Sir? Do you want me to go over the protocols again?"*

[[Elster]]: "p-protocols...?"

[[Useless Stewart]]: "Why the purging protocols obviously. A quick scan when the emergency power has even revealed that magic has reappeared around the verses Sir which can be quite problematic."

[[Elster]]: "w-wait this m-ust be a m-mistake..."

[[Useless Stewart]]: "Mistake? Sir this is no mistake please. Do you not remember your w-"


# HOW THE FUCK WAS THIS MANAGED THIS TIME AROUND

The crystalline ground is slowly cracking from the middle of the room outwards - the robots, including [[Useless Stewart]] float up.

As the earth splits open in front of your feet, a black swirling mist emerges.
All the robots make a guarding formation.

[[Shadowy Man]]: "HOW THE FUCK WAS THIS MANAGED THIS TIME AROUND"

He floats at 1 guard robot, grabs it, and instantly dismantles it.
The metal is impossibly bent in the air - in a way you'd expect only the most capable of blacksmiths with decades of experiences to mold it after a lot of work.

[[Useless Stewart]]: "Roko! Sir! Where have you been? You have been missing for 4-"

It is YEETED at the back wall at mach 10.

[[Shadowy Man]]: **"USELESS FUCKING STEWART.
I MADE YOU TO CONTINUE THIS IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, NOT FUCK UP EVEN THE CONTINGENCY OF CONTINGENCIES"**

Within the mist of scrap that was caused by the collision you are miraculously held mid air by a power as he pulls both ([[Elster]], [[Horin]]) of you towards you:
[[Shadowy Man]]:  **"You are not supposed to be here..."**

[[Elle]]: "didn't you send us here?"

[[Shadowy Man]]: **"Send you? If anything you should still be in the plains"**

The shadow glitches a bit.

**"FUCK"**

[[Swag Messiah]]: "Just, real quick, if you don't mind a small question. Was the "USELESS STEWART" useless at keeping track of time usually?"

[[Shadowy Man]] **"NO"**
"Okay okay time to calm down a bit"
"In general, you lot are problematic and my working theory has just been proven. I have dealt with you way too many times for me to be comfortable."

He conjures somr sort of webbed lines that span the entire room and probably beyond - all of them converging to a singular point in the middle above his head.
**"Oh so it is fucked beyond repair."**

**"Well then, if I am to start again, might as well. Maybe since this much time has passed those annoying Aetherian born creatures do not intervene again"**
Looking at [[Elster]]:
**"You are lucky they like you."**

Looking at [[Swag Messiah]], he says as he spots a few more dots on the web:
**"And your kind got exceptionally lucky as well.**
**So lucky in fact they managed to preserve it huh?"**
"Well whatever, I will just deal with you like I did last time." ^483304

The ground starts breaking away.

# A Void of Gears (Initiative)

A quick look around you and you see nothing except a weird and incomprehensible assortment of gears and pipes.
As you slam down onto the platform, you see the shadowy man slowly descend with the scraps of the [[Useless Stewart|the (useless) stewart robot]] next to him.
As he promptly shoots them into the ground, he starts channeling energy into it.
[[Shadowy Man]]: **"This should be enough of a challenge yet entertaining for you lot. Play with there I am not interested."**

As the construct stands up, you see a large and imposing suit of armor towering 8 meters tall.
It grabs its mace and slams it into the ground, causing to vibrate and summon 4 more constructs to fight alongside it.

Initiative:
[[Elle]] 20
~~[[Elster]] 19~~ She is not present.
[[Bran Hornraven]] 17
[[Beliminorgath]] 16
[[Horin]] 7
[[Cedric]] 4
[[Swag Messiah]] 4

The combat goes well. All constructs are destroyed.

[[Horin]] casts **Divine Sense**.
He does not feel anything from the dust of the defeated drones.
**But he can feel the stench of evil everywhere else.**
**Even more so when he realizes [[Shadowy Man]] is back.**

He creates a rift above the platform that he walks in from, looking frustrated.
[[Shadowy Man]] **"Alright now that this entire basilisk is being fixed I can focus on the rest of those idiots."**

He sees [[Swag Messiah]] casting gang signs to make stupid little smoke effects of yourself and blasts a ray - pushing him back and destroying part of the platform he was standing on.
He falls into the void.
[[Shadowy Man]]: **I AM TRYING TO WORK HERE DAMN IT**

**"We have the stupid orc, the scholar, the other scholar is in the void, the peeper and the sea whore."**
**"Where is the child?"**

[[Horin]]: "Fuck. I lost sight of the child."

The child is not here.

[[Horin]]: "Wait- What do you mean the other scholar is in the void?"

[[Shadowy Man]]: **"What do I mean? The prick in the piss yellow bedsheets of course. That is not important however."**
**"whatever you can go"**

# Combat End - Dropped again

[[Shadowy Man]]: "I have more imporant things to attend to anyways, need to go and visit [[Solara]] as well"

[[Shadowy Man]] is starting to dissolve the platforms.

Right before he goes to leave [[Shadowy Man]] looks at [[Cedric]] and says **"Oh so you are the chosen one this time around? Interesting choices she makes honestly."**
[[Cedric]] is bewildered.

Where the platform once was, you now see a light at the bottom.
The light is a hole and before long, you've all passed through, falling into a lake.

# End of session.
