# RECAP

[[Elster]] does tell us some stuff, before leaving.

General stuff:
- Elster got the funni glove from "the third party, funny bunch"
- None of us are supposed to be in this (normal world, not this temporary bunker) plane.
- Roko is not just "a powerful mage" or something, he is "the magic itself and much more"

Player characters:
[[Elle]]:
- has a girl or something and she's in a "cage" that Elster saw thanks to Ariane

[[Swag Messiah]]:
- was a great asset in the war against Roko in his home
- completely fucking loosing it
- alzheimer? wtf

[[Horin]]:
- was born in the war against Roko. He says they were winning, and thinks his world made it alongside the Shadowfell.
- realizes how unhelpful his actions were in [[Session 8 - CHAOS]] and regrets it

[[Beliminorgath]]:
- exhausted, goes schizo against Elster and then nini time

# Start

> Bran is on autopilot for the entire thing, but hes technically present

We're locked in this room, basically.

Elster looks over the room "All of you, neither of you should ever be here."
"I mean your existence in this very set of planes, little interplanar travellers you lot~"

"If you'd be so willing, some answers would be nice right about now" Beli says, still chilling on the floor.

She sticks the blade into the wall and uses the handle as an arm's rest, leaning on it as she looks  at Beli "If you were so kind as to share your experience I could shed some light on it. Starting from your arrival, preferably"

Elle:
"The beginning? We were thrown into the void and stuck there for seemingly millions of years? Roko threw me in, I don't know for the others"
"Then, we were recently told by Erik I think that some unknown third party meddled with that situation, got us out of the void. That's when we first met you, in that tunnel."
"You know what happened in that place"
"But afterward, when we splitted off, we found our way in a lake that's in a forest west of Knife's Edge"

Elster lazily looks back at Elle "Just the first bit was fine, no need to dump your life's trauma on me right now as I already have my hands full with that little clueless brat" she sighs "So, the third party, funny little bunch, I'm sure you've seen the device at our meeting earlier, got it from them I suppose"
"But that's enough about them" she gets off the wall suddenly glaring at Horin "And you, don't even start, I can barely hold myself in control when I look at you by what you did".

Elster faces Elle again and walks over to her "I've heard of your little precious girl and I've had the pleasure of seeing her cage myself through Ariane" she smugs at her before continuing quietly "and it looked staggeringly empty..."
"It's... Truly heartbreaking to know  you don't return your feelings to her, despite how hard she tried to reach you..."

Beli earlier had a schizo moment and asked for.. forgiveness for his sins? from Elster?
Then he starts not believing that Elster (soft spoken, half broken from session 1) is the same person as right now, and starts believing that this HAS to be some sort of "body snatcher".

Swag is also fucking absolutely loosing it

Elster to [[Swag Messiah|Swag]]:
"I'm glad for what they did with [[Topazia]] you insufferable little shit, you should be ashamed for what you've devolved into as I'm sure if any of your comrades saw you now they'd lose all hope they've ever had, if they're still alive" ^34b283

Swag goes "yeah" but doesnt actually recognize the name Topazia...

Elle snaps out of her thoughts
"Do you know him from before all that?"
Elster glares down at the wriggling mess of a being beneath her for a bit before turning to Elle "He was a great asset in the war against Roko and his toys, the only one to have successfully fought back as far as I'm aware."
"It's really a shame to see him like this, but... who am I to talk, really?"

Horin stops dead in his tracks when hearing that. "...This- Roko. You say he is a powerful mage?"
She turns to Horin "Aha, the first victim speaking up, curious how you don't know." she steps over the floormage closer to Horin "Roko is not just a mage, he's like the magic itself and much more"

He quickly turns over to Elster. "The magic- oh..." He pauses for a second.
"...I was born in the war against him. My world's war, atleast that's what i thought before... about three days ago. All I heard was rumours as to what we were fighting. " He chuckled weakly. "We were winning, So I wouldn't say his world was the only one successful enough to hold them back." 

Elster clears her throat as she sees Elle and Horin conversing before continuing "You say you were winning but so did he-" she points at the floorwizard "Seeing how his world is now forfeit to darkness and you're both here doesn't give too high hopes for yours."

Swag has a delayed realization about Topazia... or does he?

Beli eventually snaps and schizo tries to hit "the body snatcher"
He hits, but she uses Clock's Unwinding to negate the hit.
Beli collapses on the ground from exhaustion.
"Funny", Elster walks out of the room through the main door, disappearing into the void.

Eventually, Elle and Horin mostly talk between eachother about Horin being so obsessed to catch Elster and yeah uhh he has the extra delayed realization "but i thought i was helping" 
all 4 braincells in his orc brain finally connected

Swag steals 13 water rocks lmfao
